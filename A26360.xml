            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Many things I know might be ſaid in disfavour of it; but the Piety of the Deſign is all I offer in excuſe. Beſides, I underſtand not the Uſe or Benefit of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, and therefore I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104696:6"/> this Account without them.</p>
                  <p>It was my ſingular Happineſs, not only to be born of Chriſtian Parents, but of ſuch as were true Members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whoſe Piety took care to make choice of fit Perſons to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me to Holy Baptiſm the firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> after my Birth, according to the Rule and laudable Practice of this National Church.</p>
                  <p>The Perſons, I ſay, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me to Holy Baptiſm, were Canonically qualified for that Charitable Office, being of good Report, and ſuch as had received the Holy Communion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe I call my <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmother,</hi> whom I bear a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſuitable to that Appellation. And by my Parents approbation, theſe gave me that Name, which puts me in mind of the Chriſtian Faith, in which I was baptized, and by which I was liſted under Chriſt, and became his Soldier and Servant. And it is called my
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104696:6"/> 
                     <hi>Chriſtian Name,</hi> becauſe by it I ſtand related unto Chriſt, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from Men of all other Religions, as <hi>Jews, Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Name was given me at Baptiſm, whereby being made a Chriſtian, I was entitled to all the Priviledges appertaining to thoſe who truly bear that Name. So that I who by Nature did not belong unto the Church of Chriſt, which is his Myſtical Body, being baptiz'd, became a Member of the ſame. And being a Member thereof, I am no more, as I was by Nature, a Child of Wrath, but a Child of God by Adoption, through Chriſt, who is the Son of God by Nature. And being thus a Child, I am alſo an Heir of God, and Joint-Heir with Chriſt, to a Kingdom of Glory.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Priviledges were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon me in Baptiſm not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but on Condition that I would perform what my Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104696:7"/> and Godmother did vow and promiſe in my behalf, when I was baptized. For notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that both mine and all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are expreſly commanded to be diligent in teaching their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren God's Holy Word, and to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Parents may die, and ſo be uncapable to do this; or they may be negligent, and ſo either not do it at all, or not as they ought; the Church, as 'twere, took Bond or Security of my Godfathers and Godmother for my pious Education: Who are therefore called my <hi>Sureties,</hi> and who were encharged to have a Religious Care to teach me, as ſoon as I was able to learn, what a ſolemn Vow, Promiſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion I made by them in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                  <p>Now, the things which theſe Sureties avouched to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, are Three, (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104696:7"/> to the Three Benefits aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me when I was baptized.) The firſt was an utter renouncing of all thoſe Spiritual Enemies that inceſſantly war againſt my Soul; namely, the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>So that the firſt Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my I am to renounce, forſake, and fight againſt, is the Devil, that evil Spirit, that loſt Angel, whoſe malignity againſt me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his continual ſolliciting and tempting me to Sin, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing me when I have ſinn'd; and reſiſting and hindring me when I am about to do good. Whom, according to my Sureties Bond, I ſtand obliged to renounce, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all his Works; which, in general, are all Sins committed by his inſtigation; and, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, all Sins committed after his Example, or which bear his Image; ſuch as Murder, Lying, Pride, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and the like.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104696:8"/>
                  <p>I am alſo bound (by vertue of the Bond my Sureties gave in my Name) to renounce this preſent evil World. By which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe wicked Men who are Enemies to Godlineſs, and all thoſe other Creatures which the Devil, the Prince of this World, uſeth as Baits and Snares to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to Sin. But beſides my renouncing the World thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I am alſo to forſake and withſtand its Pomps and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that is, all Pleaſures, Pride and Wealth, when they become injurious to Religion, and divert or ſtop me in my Exerciſe of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety: Which they will certainly do, if my Affections towards them are inordinate, immoderate, or unſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe Worldly Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties only gratifie my Carnal Part, and Senſitive Appetite, I am alſo bound to renounce that which they gratifie: I mean, the Fleſh, or my unmortified
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104696:8"/> Corruption, which is Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder me from doing Good, but doth alſo incline and ſpur me on to do Evil.</p>
                  <p>For I find, that from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified Corruption there ſprings up in me many inordinate Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and evil Concupiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are called the Luſts of the Fleſh: By means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (until they are mortified) I am brought to entertain the Temptations of the Devil, and to abuſe the good things of the World to Sin. And though the renouncing of theſe Luſts of the Fleſh, together with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and the World, be made an Article of my Chriſtianity, and a Condition upon which the Priviledges of Baptiſm are beſtowed upon me; yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are my ſoreſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and continually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring not only my preſent,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104696:9"/> but my eternal Ruine, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other tie) Self-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation prompts me to withſtand them.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing promiſed in my behalf, when I was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, is my Belief of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſtianity, ſumm'd up in the Apoſtles Creed: My Faith of which, if it be not more than either barely Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical and Temporary, I ſhall not ſurpaſs the very Devil, and wicked hypocritical Men in believing; for the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves alway Hiſtorically, and the other only hypocritically for a time.</p>
                  <p>But the Faith I vowed in Baptiſm is a firm and conſtant Aſſent unto the Word of God, and Goſpel of Man's Salvation, and an unſhaken Reliance upon the ſame: So that the whole Scripture is the General, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104696:9"/> the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, ſumm'd up in the Creed, is the Particular Object of my Belief.</p>
                  <p>And I look upon this Faith to be ſo neceſſary for me, and every Chriſtian, that I forfeit that Title without it: For a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is but another Word for Chriſtian. But ſtill I know, that how neceſſary ſoever Faith is to the Salvation of my Soul, yet it is not to be got by my own Power; for it is the Gift of God, and the Gracious Work of the Holy Ghoſt, which doth enable me to aſſent unto, and rely upon the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe Faith will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to my Juſtification, without Works of Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt; therefore my Sureties undertook that I ſhould keep God's Holy Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and walk in the ſame
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104696:10"/> all the days of my Life. So that I do acknowledge my ſelf bound to pay Obedience to the whole Will of God, revealed in his word. And I cannot think my ſelf fit to come to the Lord's Table, unleſs I am reſolved to keep God's Law, and have regard unto all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; and that too with my whole Heart, or ſincerely; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, without intermiſſion or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance.</p>
                  <p>But when I profeſs this to be my Duty, it is not as if I thought I were to be ſaved by the Tenor of the Firſt Covenant, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whereof was perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for this I am no way able to perform. But becauſe I hope to be ſaved by the Second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, called the Covenant of Grace, I think my ſelf bound to perform the Condition thereof, namely, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or Faith fruitful in good Works; which good Works are the genuine Off-ſpring of my Faith, and do flow as naturally
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104696:10"/> from it, as Fruits from their Tree; and without which, my Faith is dead. And you have ever taught me to ſet a peculiar value upon good Works, becauſe through means thereof I glorifie God, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my Neighbour, and juſtifie and declare my Faith before Men. And according to my preſent Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Religion, I look upon Faith and good Works to make up my whole Duty, as a Chriſtian: And theſe, I hold, are not to be ſeperated in my Practice, becauſe Faith without Works is dead, and Works without Faith cannot pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>And tho' it is my firm Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obſerve them both, and to believe and do as my Sureties have promiſed for me; yet I know, I cannot do ſo, but by the aſſiſtance and help of God; and therefore I will by diligent and humble Prayer beg a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſupply of Grace, to enable me to believe and do all things which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104696:11"/> at Baptiſm were ſtipulated an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And I humbly pray God by his preventing Grace to incline my Will; by his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace to give me Strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by his conſummating Grace to bring me actually to perform all thoſe Duties which in Holy Baptiſm my God-fathers and God-mother under ook in my ſtead.</p>
                  <p>And as you ever minded and made me ſenſible how greatly I was bound to my Sureties, for what they did for me at Baptiſm; ſo you likewiſe have let me know the Obligation I had to take up their Bond as ſoon as I was able,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104696:11"/> and ſo to diſcharge them. And this I did at Confirmation, when I ſolemnly took upon my ſelf to believe and do all that my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Sureties had vow'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed I ſhould believe and do. But now, alas! being conſcious to my ſelf that I have broken my Baptiſmal Covenant, it is my earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſire to be admitted to the Lord's Table, on purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it.</p>
                  <p>But before my admiſſion to that Heavenly Entertainment, I am of opinion that I ought to have a competent Underſtanding of the more eminent Parts of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which you have taught me; and they are theſe Four, namely, Faith, Obedience, Prayer, and the Sacraments. And to you who are to admit me, I think my ſelf bound to give an Account of my Knowledge in each of theſe, and to deſire your Judgment whether or no it be ſufficient in order to my Admiſſion.</p>

                     <p>In this Second Article of the Creed I have been taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt, and that he is the only Son of God, and of the ſame Divine Eſſence with him: That he is called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he is the only Saviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: and that he is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> becauſe he was anointed to the Three Offices of a Prophet, Prieſt, and King; which Three, under the Law, were in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Anointed.</p>

                     <p>And I believe, That all theſe Three met in Chriſt; and that as a Prophet he doth inſtruct his Church, outwardly by his Word, and inwardly by his Spirit. And I believe, That as a Prieſt he made ſatisfaction unto God for the Sins of Mankind, when he once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up himſelf upon the Croſs; and that by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he reconciled God and Man. And further I believe, That as a Prieſt he continually makes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for me, and all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, at the right Hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven, and doth bleſs me in turning me from my Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, I believe, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not only <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, Anointed to be a Prophet and a Prieſt in the ſenſe now declared; but that he was alſo Anointed to be a King: And that, as ſuch, he doth govern and preſerve his Church: he erects and ſets up his Throne in the Hearts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104696:15"/> for it reſpects Chriſt's Death, upon which the whole Hinge of my Salvation turns. I find the Hiſtory of it to be clearly and fully ſet forth by the Evangeliſts; and as to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, St. <hi>Paul</hi> valued it ſo highly, that he deſired to know nothing elſe but Jeſus Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Now by my believing of the Crucifixion, I confeſs, that according to the Prophecies Chriſt ſuffered in his Humane Nature. both in Soul and Body; his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature being uncapable of ſuffering. And that this hapned at the time when <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea;</hi> who being addicted to Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and ſinful compliance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Chriſt to be crucified: And as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent on the Pole in the Wilderneſs, ſo was Chriſt lifted up on the Croſs; and by a painful, ignominious, and accurſed Death, did expiate my ſin, and redeemed me from all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104696:16"/> vain Converſation, and from the Curſe of the Law, and gave me an Entrance into Heaven. All which unſpeakable Benefits are juſtly to be aſcribed to the Blood of Chriſt, becauſe it was of infinite value, as being the Blood of that Perſon who was God as well as Man.</p>
                     <p>And as I believe Chriſt volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily laid down his Life, and that his Soul was really ſeparated from his Body; ſo I likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that as a dead Man he was buried, after the manner of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation; namely, that he was bound in Grave-clothes with Spices, and laid the Grave, with an heavy Stone rolled to the mouth of the Sepulcher. All which were certain Tokens of his Death, as being the uſual known Rites of a Jewiſh Funeral. I alſo believe, That Chriſt being dead, his Soul and Body remain'd in a ſeparate condition, under the Power of Death; and that his Soul was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to the Body before it did
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104696:16"/> putrifie in the Grave. But as to the various Opinions about his Deſcent into Hell, I think them either too high, or too unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for my reſearch.</p>
                     <p>And as you have taught me, ſo I believe, that Chriſt's Birth, Death, and Burial, or being under the Dominion of Death, were the Three Degrees of his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; anſwerable to which were the Three Degrees of his Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, namely, Reſurrection, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, and Glorification in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

                     <p>And as to the time when he aroſe, I have been taught, and do believe, That it was the Third day after his Death, which hapned to be the Firſt day of the Week: Which Day we celebrate in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Reſurrection, and which has immemorially been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Lord's Day.</hi>

                     <p>I believe, That Chriſt aſcended by the ſame Power he roſe: And that this was no other Power than that of his own Divinity; by which, as an High-Prieſt of good things to come, he once aſcended viſibly and locally into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens, as the High-Prieſt once every Year entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy of Holies. And the End of his Aſcenſion was, I believe, to prepare a place for Believers, and to receive them to it; that where he is, they might be alſo.</p>
                     <p>After Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven, he took his Place at the Right-Hand of God. Not that I think God, who is a moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Spirit, hath either Right or Left Hand; but that this is ſpoken after the manner of Men who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104696:18"/> place thoſe whom they will moſt honour upon their Right-hand. And from Chriſt's being thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Heaven, I collect, That he there took up his Abode in a State of Majeſty and Power, to ſhew that he was above all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Heaven and Earth, and that he is exalted to be the King of Saints, and Judge of Sinners; the Prince of our Salvation, and High-Prieſt of our Profeſſion: and that in him there was an Union of the Regal Power and Prieſtly Office, when he ſat down at the Right-hand of the Father Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that by the former he is perfectly able to ſubdue all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and by the latter he doth ever intercede for, and eternally ſave thoſe that are his.</p>

                     <p>After this plain Account given by me of the Articles which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Bleſſed Trinity, I will now give the like Account of thoſe that follow; which reſpect ſuch only as truly believe in, and obey and Worſhip the Trinity in Unity; and who are here called the Church. Which I plainly take to ſignifie all thoſe whom Chriſt hath called out of the World, to be his peculiar People: Over whom he hath a Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in regard of which they willingly and chearfully pay him Homage, and obey his Law and Ordinances.</p>
                     <p>For by <hi>Church</hi> I have been taught to underſtand the Corporation and General Family of all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which Family truly deſerves
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104696:20"/> to be called Holy, in reſpect of its Head, which is Chriſt, who is Holy in himſelf, and whoſe Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is imputed to all ſincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: And who through the Grace given to them, do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſtudy, and endeavour to be Holy.</p>
                     <p>And the Church, in this famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar acception, I believe is Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, as well as Holy; and that there are in all the Quarters of the World thoſe who by Baptiſm are admitted into it, and ſo made Members of Chriſt's Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who are guided by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nouriſhed by the Word and Sacrament; and who are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Rule and Government of the Biſhops and Paſtors, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called to their Offices.</p>
                     <p>And of this <hi>Society</hi> of Believers, which conſtitute the Church, ſome are in a ſtate of War, continually fighting againſt their own and Chriſt's Enemies; but yet in daily expectation of Triumph, and a

And ſome are in a ſtate of <hi>Peace;</hi> for having fought the good Fight of Faith, and finiſhed their Warfare, they are entred into their Maſter's Joy: And theſe make the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> which is crowned in Heaven. Now, theſe I hold are not two divers Churches, but the ſame Church under a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent State and Condition: For I believe the <hi>Church</hi> to be eſſentially but one.</p>
                     <p>And as Chriſt's Myſtical Body the Church has an <hi>

                     <p>Now Sin, as I have been <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,</hi> is of two ſorts; the one Original, which is the ſin of <hi>my Nature;</hi> the other <hi>Actual,</hi> which is the ſin of <hi>my Converſation.</hi> The former I brought with me into the World, the latter I commit while
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104696:22"/> I live therein. And both theſe ſorts of ſin deſerve Eternal Death and can only be pardon'd by the Merits of Chriſt. (For ſin being a Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, it can only be forgiven by him whoſe Law it <hi>tranſgreſſeth.</hi>) For Remiſſion of ſins is the ſecond Priviledge of the Church, which is preached to all in the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſealed in Baptiſm; wherein I believe my Original Sin is preſently pardon'd, and that my <hi>Actual Sins</hi> committed <hi>after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> ſhall be <hi>pardon'd,</hi> if I truly repent me of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Now, this my Belief of the Forgiveneſs of Sins, ſuppoſes that I believe, That God graciouſly and freely, without any Deſert on Man's part, gave his Son to die for the World; and, That for the ſake of his meritorious Death, he remits the Fault, abſolves from the Guilt, and acquits from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>all truly penitent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sinners.</hi>

                     <p>And I do further believe, That he imputes to them the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his own <hi>Son,</hi> and his Righteouſneſs, and by means thereof accounts them <hi>juſt</hi> in his <hi>ſight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I believe, That all who are juſtified, and thus acquitted, have Holineſs in ſome degree, according to the Condition of this Life. Which Holineſs, tho' it cannot altogether diſcharge them from ſin, yet it doth not ſuffer it to <hi>reign</hi> over them: So that a juſtified Perſon is not under its Dominion, nor yields himſelf a <hi>Vaſſal</hi> to it; but reſiſts its Commands, and makes it die daily.</p>
                     <p>And for the greater ſecurity of the Forgiveneſs of ſins, God hath committed to his Miniſters an indiſpenſible Power and Charge to preach <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> as the Condition of this Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He hath likewiſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>intercede,</hi>

And my believing the Life Everlaſting, ſhould make me diligent to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my ſhort moment of Time here, that my Everlaſting Life hereafter may be a Life of Joy, and not of Miſery.</p>
                     <p>And thus from all the Articles of the Creed, I am to draw Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to ſtrengthen me in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Practice; to which end my learning and believing of them is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104696:26"/> deſigned. And till I do this, I cannot rationally pretend to make good what I promiſed when I was baptized, namely, To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith. And without this, I think my ſelf unfit to partake of the Lord's Supper.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed to <hi>Obedience,</hi> which you have frequently taught me, is the ſecond <hi>Head</hi> of my Chriſtian Profeſſion, and that it has the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> for its Rule; and of theſe, as well as of the Creed, I ought to have a convenient Knowledge, both as to the Words and Meaning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the Lord's Table: Becauſe the keeping of God's Commandments is one part of that Vow which I have broken, and come thither to renew.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, I have been Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, That in ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is ſomething <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:104696:26"/> and ſomething <hi>forbidden;</hi> ſo that I may be guilty of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing it, either by doing what I ought not to do, or by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undone what I ought to do.</p>
                     <p>As to the things forbidden by the <hi>Firſt Commandment,</hi> I have learned, that they are chiefly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, or the Denial of God's <hi>Being,</hi> and the multiplying and ſerving of falſe Gods; as alſo the not ſerving the only true God aright. And of this laſt I look upon my ſelf to become egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly guilty, when I ſuffer any thing to ſhare with God in my Worſhip of him; and when I am guilty of Hypocriſie, Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Indevotion, Lukewarmneſs, Hereſie, Schiſm, <hi>Apoſtaſie, Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Preſumption, Deſpair, Carnal Security, Pride, Diſobedience, Impatience and Murmuring, and wilful Ignorance of his Word.</p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:104696:27"/>
                     <p>And I have been taught, That by this ſame Commandment it is required of me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but One God, and to have him for <hi>my</hi> God, and to love, fear, obey, and truſt in him above all others, and to ſerve him truly all the days of my life.</p>
                     <p>And as to the things forbidden in the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> I doubt not but they are, The appointing of any kind of Image for Religious Worſhip; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting of God by a viſible likeneſs of any thing; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Creatures; the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Worſhip of the True God, or the worſhipping him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a falſe manner.</p>
                     <p>And the Duties enjoined in this Commandment, are, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the only True God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Preſcription; to worſhip him both in my Body and Spirit; to bear a due regard to all the Parts of his Worſhip,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104696:27"/> as Prayer, the Word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to come to them with ſuitable Preparation, and to yield a due Veneration to all <hi>Places, Times, Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet apart for God's Worſhip. And to ſuch as thus worſhip him, he hath promiſed Mercy and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but has threatned to be a ſevere Puniſher of them that do otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Third Commandment</hi> I am forbidden all irreverent Thoughts of God; all Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or diſhonourable mention of his Name; all Perjury, or Breach of lawful Oaths; all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning the Name of God and True Religion to be blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>And, on the other ſide, I am enjoyned, to think and ſpeak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently of God's Name and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; to glorifie him in his Holy Word and Ordinances; to uſe his Name with Reverence in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104696:28"/> taking Religious Oaths; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap> ſuch Oaths with an holy Care and Conſcience; and to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his Name by a pious Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth Commandment</hi> requires me to keep holy, or to ſanctifie all ſuch days, which are ſeparated from a Common to a Religious uſe.</p>
                     <p>After God had in ſix days fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Works of the firſt Creation, he ſanctified the Seventh Day, and commanded his People to ſanctifie it. But after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, inſtead of the Seventh Day from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation, the Firſt Day of the Week was hallowed, and called emphatically, the <hi>Lords-day.</hi> And the Obſervation of it has been the univerſal practice of the Chriſtian Church. And I think my ſelf bound to ſpend this day in an eſpecial attendance on God's Service; ſuch as Prayer, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104696:28"/> Participation of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Relieving the Poor, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon the Works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Redemption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And on this day I have been taught, that I am forbidden all Worldly Undertakings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, vain Sports and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, and all actions but thoſe of Piety, Mercy, Neceſſity and Decency.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe four firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſpect my Duty toward God; and the ſix that follow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard my Neighbour and my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And the firſt of theſe ſix (which is the <hi>Fift of the Ten) Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> may be called the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Relations; For it teaches me firſt my Duty to my Natural Parents, and that I am to honour them. Which impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that I am to fear, reverence, ſuccour, and obey them. It ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly teacheth me my Duty to my Political Parents, namely, the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104696:29"/> King, and all in lawful Authorit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> under him: Whom alſo I am to honour and obey. It (thirdly) teaches me my Duty to my Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Parents, Spiritual Paſtor and Teachers. And it likewiſe binds me to carry my ſelf lowly and reverently to all my betters. In ſhort, I have been taught, that this Commandment doth concern all the mutual Duties among all ſorts and degrees of <hi>Inferiours</hi> and <hi>Superiours,</hi> from the King to the Maſter of a Cottage. And there is an eſpecial Promiſe annexed to this Precept, to encourage all to obey it, in performing their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Duties one to another.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Sixth Commandment,</hi> which concerns Man's life, all thoſe things are forbidden me which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way tend to the injury of the ſame; as Hatred, cauſleſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Anger, contrivance of Man's Death, occaſions of, and actual and wilful Murder. And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104696:29"/> at the ſame time this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requires me, as far as I am able, to preſerve the life of Man; and that I ſuſtain it with Food and Raiment, that I prudently avoid all Dangers, and conſcientiouſly fly from all ſuch Vices, whereby Humane Life is hazarded; and which are deſtructive both of the Body and Soul of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them. Such as Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Seventh Commandment,</hi> which concerns a chaſte Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am forbidden all acts of Adultery, and Fornication, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with unlawful Marriage. And likewiſe all ſuch <hi>Thoughts, Looks, Attire,</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> as prompt and inveigle to Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have further been taught that by this Commandment all ſuch things are forbidden as may occaſion any of theſe, as Idleneſs, Exceſs in Eating and Drinking. So that on the contrary I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104696:30"/> to keep my Body in <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Soberneſs,</hi> and <hi>Chastity:</hi> to preſerve Modeſty in Thought, Behaviour, and Apparel.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Eighth Commandment,</hi> which concerns Man's Eſtate, I am, as I have been taught, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden all defraudation, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Stealth, Oppreſſion, and violent Robbery, Sacriledge, or pillaging of God; all Bribery and withholding other mens dues, with all covetous deſires.</p>
                     <p>And on the contrary, I am bound by vertue of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to give to all their Dues, to live in ſome lawful Calling, and therein to be diligent: to reſtore that which hath been ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, to give Alms to the Poor, and to avoid the Company of all ſuch as would entice me to break this Law.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ninth Commandment,</hi> concerns Man's Good Name, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104696:30"/> forbids me to lye, to raiſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or to divulge any falſe or malicious Reports againſt my Neighbour. It likewiſe forbids all groundleſs Suſpicions, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuborning and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of falſe Witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>And on the other hand, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns me to love and ſpeak the Truth; to preſerve my own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and when it is ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to vindicate my own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and the Innocency of my Neighbour, when I know either to be unjuſtly aſperſed.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Laſt Commandment,</hi> which eſpecially reſpects Man's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, I am forbidden to covet my Neighbours Goods, of what nature or ſort ſoever: And I am required, to regulate my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: to reſtrain all ſinful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; to be content with my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition, to learn and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour truly to get mine own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and to do my Duty in that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104696:31"/> ſtate of life unto which it hath pleaſed God to call me.</p>
                     <p>And now having given this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Ten Commandments, I leave it to your upright Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether my knowledge of them be fufficient to qualifie me for the Holy Communion.</p>
                     <p>The Obedience I owe to theſe Precepts, is the next thing that importantly concerns me. And here I openly confeſs, that it is not in my power to obey God's Commandments, without his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, but that if this be once ſhed in my heart, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to obey them. And when my Obedience is <hi>true, faithful,</hi> and <hi>ſincere,</hi> though mixed with much weakneſs, imperfection, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins, yet, (if therein I live not wilfully impenitent) I do unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly believe God will accept and Crown it.</p>
                     <p>But I have been often taught, that this <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104696:31"/> be obtained but by diligent Prayer. Which you have told me is the Third General Branch of my Chriſtianity, and that it has for its Rule that Divine Form Chriſt compoſed, and which from him is called <hi>The Lord's Prayer.</hi> And this conſiſts of a <hi>Preface, ſix Petitions,</hi> and a <hi>Concluſion:</hi> Of each of which I will now give ſuch an account as I have learned from you, beginning with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, namely,
<q>Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein I am taught to direct my Prayers to God, as to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom I ought to approach with holy Reverence, and with humble Confidence that he will hear and grant what I pray for.</p>
                     <p>And to him only Prayers ought to be made, becauſe he only is every where preſent to receive them, and every way able
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104696:32"/> to grant what is prayed for.</p>
                     <p>The Six Petitions now follow, whereof the Three firſt concern God's Glory: and the Three laſt concern Man's Wants.</p>

                     <p>In this Petition I am taught to deſire, and chiefly to endeavour the glorification of God's Holy Name, which Name in general ſignifies God himſelf: and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular all his Titles, as <hi>Lord, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> &amp;c. next, all his glorious Attributes or Excellencies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with every thing that has a peculiar relation unto him, as his Word, his Houſe, his Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <head>The Doctrine of the Sacraments.</head>
                        <p>In the Creed I have been taught that God by his Son hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me and all Mankind; and in the Doctrine of the Sacraments (which makes the laſt part of my Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm) I have been taught, how that by them God doth exhibit and ſeal unto Believers, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which Chriſt purchaſed for them.</p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:104696:40"/>
                        <p>And as to the Number of theſe Sacraments, I have learned they are but Two, and only Two, namely, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> And I am convinced, that all Men ought to receive theſe Two, who deſired to be ſaved: Which I do not ſo underſtand, as if God could not ſave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; but that they are the Inſtrumental Means, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Seals, by which God hath promiſed to convey and aſſure Chriſt's Merits to me, and commanded me this way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; ſo that wilfully to neglect, or to want the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when they may be had, is to caſt aſide God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which every Chriſtian is bound to obey. And as I have been taught, ſo I look upon the Sacraments, as the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Means which God requires to be obſerved of them unto whom he imparts his Grace: Not as if this Grace, whereof a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104696:40"/> Worthy Receiver partakes, were a Natural or Supernatural Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Sacrament, but that it is from God himſelf, which is the Author of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo that Grace is receiv'd from God by means of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
                        <p>And this I have learned not only from you who are our Pariſh-Divine, but alſo from Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> whoſe Judgment I have heard much praiſed by many of our beſt Clergy. This (ſaith he) is the Neceſſity of Sacraments: That ſaving Grace, which Chriſt Originally is, or hath for the General Good of his whole Church, by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he ſeverally derives into every Member thereof. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſerve as the Inſtruments of God to that End and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Moral Inſtruments, the Uſe whereof is in our Hands, the Effect in his: For the Uſe we have his expreſs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104696:41"/> for the Effect his Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditional Promiſe: So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our Obedience to the one there is no apparent aſſurance of the other: As contrariwiſe where the Signs and Sacrament of his Grace, are not eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> through Contempt unreceiv'd or not receiv'd with Contempt We are not to doubt, but they really give what they promiſe and are what they ſignifie.</p>
                        <p>I fully acquieſce (as to this Point) in the Judgment of this Conſiderable Author. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Chriſtian Church, are, as I ſaid, Two; namely, Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper. By Baptiſm I have my Admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Entrance into the Church; and it is the waſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, by which I am new born: And by the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (to which I now earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire to be admitted) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall be nouriſhed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and grow up in Chriſt.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104696:41"/> And theſe Two Sacraments I am ſure were of Chriſt's own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. And ſeeing that by the one I am entred into the Chriſtian Profeſſion, and by the other I am therein ſtrengthned and made perfect; I ſee no neep of any more.</p>
                        <p>And not to trouble my ſelf with the ſecular uſe of the Word Sacrament, it ſerves my turn to underſtand it in the Senſe of the Church; which tells me it is an outward and viſible Sign of an inward and ſpiritual Grace, Ordain'd by Chriſt himſelf, and a means whereby we receive the ſame Grace, and a Pledge to aſſure us thereof. Now, this Deſcription of a Sacrament I have been often told, is the uneaſieſt Point in all my Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm: I will therefore, in order to be better inform'd, ſet down my ſence of this Deſcription.</p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104696:42"/>
                        <p>And firſt, By an <hi>Outward and Viſible Sign,</hi> I underſtand that which preſents its ſelf to my Eye, and repreſents ſomewhat elſe to my Underſtanding. As for Example, in Baptiſm <hi>the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Viſible Sign</hi> is <hi>Water,</hi> wherein the Perſon is dipped or ſprinkled. And the inward and ſpiritual Grace which is thereby ſignified, is a Death unto Sin, and a New-birth unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, both which by the means of Baptiſm are convey'd to the Baptized.</p>
                        <p>I have heard you, Catechizing upon this Point, declare that it was the ancient manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to put the Perſon baptiz'd under Water, and then to take him out again; and that this was done to ſignifie his dying unto Sin, and riſing again to Newneſs of Life.</p>
                        <p>The firſt declared the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the deading, and putting off of ſin: The latter ſhewed the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104696:42"/> performance of thoſe Actions of Men, who being quickned by the Spirit, endeavour to ſerve God all their days in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</p>
                        <p>And in the Lord's Supper there is alſo an Outward and Viſible ſign, namely, Bread and Wine, and an inward Part or Thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, to wit, the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which are ſpiritually received by all Worthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, and which being ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, their Souls are ſtrengthned and refreſhed; and the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is wrought in the Inner Man, by the Holy Myſteries which is in the Outward by theſe Elements. And as ſtrength is from Bread, and chearfulneſs from Wine; ſo I hope, and expect, that when I am admitted to the Lord's Supper, my Heart will be eſtabliſhed by Grace, and my Soul ſtrengthned, and my Conſcience made chearful and light with the Bleſſings and Benefits that the Sacrament will
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104696:43"/> exhibit, ſeal, and convey unto me; ſtill ſuppoſing that I am in ſome competent meaſure fit to communicate. And in order to be ſo, I have learned from my Catechiſm, that theſe following Duties are required of me, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Self-Examination, Repentance, Faith, Thankfulneſs and Charity.</p>
                        <p>And for my aſſiſtance in the Knowledge and Examination of theſe Graces, I have choſen <hi>The Introduction to the Sacrament,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Doctor <hi>Addiſon,</hi> Dean of <hi>Lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And the following words declare, that this Bleſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in turning every one from his iniquity. And thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means uſed by Chriſt for this end (which ought to be reckon'd for the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings) are (1.) A Succeſſion of Prieſts, (an Holy Order of men) whom he continually employs by their Miniſtry to work in mens hearts a ſincere Obedience to the Goſpel. (2.) A giving to all humble Chriſtians ſtrength to enable them to overcome ſin. (3.) His interceding with God for his Servants, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in well doing. And as he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104696:64"/> did this laſt while he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, praying that his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Faith might not fail: ſo he ſtill purſues the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praying for the <hi>Church,</hi> now that he is aſcended up into Heaven; where, ſitting at the right hand of God, he makes requeſt for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. And it is your duty, as a Chriſtian, to comply with Chriſt herein, and to be willing to be thus bleſſed by him, in being turned from your ſins: and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his Prayers and Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to render all his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, the means of Repentance, void and fruitleſs, by your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful continuance in iniquity. But when you ſhall uſe theſe Bleſſings to the end they are deſigned by your Saviour, and ſhall ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do good, not expecting <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,</hi> or Salvation, upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms than Chriſt has

And that you might have no pretence to refuſe the Kingly Government of Chriſt, as too heavy and difficult, he has made his Yoke eaſie, and Burden light; having taken off from the hardneſs of the Law firſt given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and inſtead of that ſinleſs Obedience, or the never committing the leaſt ſin upon pain of <hi>death</hi> (which was required of him) he now looks for no more than your <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Endeavour to do what you are able, and accepts of <hi>ſincere</hi> Repentance where you fail or miſcarry.

For to thoſe from whom you have exacted more than is due, you are bound to make reſtitution.

                     <p>And having tried and found your Faith toward God to be ſuch, as he has promiſed not to be diſpleaſed with; your next buſineſs is to examine your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity toward your Neighbour: for it is required of them who come to the Lords Supper, <hi>to be in Charity with all Men. If thou bringeſt thy Gift to the Altar, and there remembereſt that thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift.</hi> This was our Saviour's advice to the Jews, and may thus be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your ſelf and every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: If at <hi>any time you are</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Lords Table, and there call to mind that you have done any man any Injury, do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104696:95"/> you repair firſt to that Perſon whom you have injured, uſe means to reconcile him to you, repair the wrong, and if you cannot, let him know your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, and requeſt his Pardon; and having done thus, return to compleat your intention, and receive the Sacrament in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your Peace with God and your Neighbour. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement with your Brethren, is abſolutely neceſſary, not only to make your participation of the Sacrament, but all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances acceptable to God. And you ſee it conſiſts in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of your wrong, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing it; it being reaſonable, that in order to obtain his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don whom you have injured, you acknowledge your fault to him, and to the utmoſt of your Ability make him amends.</p>

                     <p>And as to this Charity here ſpoken of, the very Elements of the Lords Supper figure and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it: for the many grains made up into one Loaf, and the many Grapes preſſed into one Cup, ſignifie, how we being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are made one Bread and one Body. And nothing can make all Chriſtians to be <hi>affectionately</hi> one, but Charity; or myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritually one, except Charity, the Bond of Peace and Union. And this is that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temper of Mind, to which Chriſtians are obliged, upon the account of the nearneſs of that relation which is amongſt them: for they have all but one <hi>Father,</hi> one <hi>Saviour,</hi> one <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> they all profeſs one <hi>Faith,</hi> have all received one and the ſame Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and all expect one and the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104696:96"/> ſame Inheritance. But if in ſpight of all this you trample Charity under Feet, and inſtead of being reconciled to your Neighbour, you malice and hate him: you are no more fit for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament than a Murderer: for ſuch are all thoſe who hate their fellow Chriſtians; according to St. <hi>John,</hi> in the third and fourth Chapters of his firſt Epiſtle.</p>

                     <p>And as Charity binds you to ſeek to be reconciled to thoſe whom you have injured, and to obtain their Pardon; ſo it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe engageth you to forgive thoſe by whom you have been wrong'd. And indeed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving others their Treſpaſſes, is the condition of obtaining the forgiveneſs of your own: for if you forgive Men their Treſpaſſes,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104696:97"/> your heavenly Father will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you; but if you forgive not men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your Treſpaſſes. This was our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours own <hi>Doctrine (Mat.</hi> 18. from <hi>verſe</hi> 23. to the end) and alſo his <hi>Practice,</hi> when he pray'd for the forgiveneſs of his <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers,</hi> and that at a time too when his own moſt grievous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies and Pains might juſtly have diverted all reſpect to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially to thoſe who were then actually putting him to death.

And I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this latter Act of Charity, becauſe I find that ſomething was ever given to the Corban of the Poor by thoſe who came to the Sacrament. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the practice of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> (the beſt Guide for the <hi>preſent</hi>) Church, you will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find that the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was ever adminiſtred without an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertory.</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 2.45, 46. you have mention made of ſelling Poſſeſſions and Goods, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to all as every man had need. And that this was done at the ſolemn times of publick Prayers, and receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, there is light enough in the Text to clear it. You read likewiſe of a Command, <hi>That upon the firſt day of the Week, every man ſhould lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him.</hi> The firſt day of the Week was that we now call <hi>Sunday,</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104696:98"/> the Lords day, whereon the Lords Supper was conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;<note place="margin">1.

And if you look into the ancient Liturgies, you will find them generally taking notice of this Religious Cuſtom. And that this was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by our own Church, is concludible from her placing <hi>Texts</hi> to perſuade to this ſort of Charity, and deſiring God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our <hi>Alms</hi> and <hi>Oblations</hi> in the Communion-office.<note place="margin">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104696:99"/> After the Sacrament was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, there was one common Table for Rich and Poor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they did eat promiſcuouſly; and what was left was given to thoſe in want.

                     <p>And in proportion to this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, when you come to the Sacrament, you are to beſtow ſomething on the Poor, that you appear not before the Lord em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, and ſerve him of that which coſt you nothing. And though you are, as to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of your Alms, left at liberty, yet you had beſt to be merciful according to your Power. If you have much, give plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; if you have little, do your diligence gladly to give of

                     <p>In the Sacrament, by a joynt communicating in the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries, you atteſt to the World your being united to Chriſt your Head, and to every true Chriſtian as a fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame Body. And as <hi>Faith</hi> unites you to Chriſt, ſo Charity alſo to his Members; and by virtue of theſe two Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Sacrament ſeals the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Members with the Head, and of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one with another. But when you come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Malice in your Soul, you can have no true Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with either; but are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the vileſt Hypocriſie, by making profeſſion of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or Brotherly Charity, whereof your Heart is void and empty. In this caſe I refer you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104696:100"/> once more to the counſel of our Saviour, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23, 24. where two things appear for your Inſtruction; <hi>viz.</hi> (1.)

That he is not to neglect or quite put off the Offering of his Gift,<note place="margin">

                     <p>And when you find your Heart duly furniſhed with Faith toward God, and (the proper effect thereof) Charity toward man, you muſt once more go down into your Soul, to ſee if it have that holy and heavenly temper called <hi>Devotion;</hi> which is a Grace ſo ſutable to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104696:100"/> of the Sacrament, that it ſeems to make up the whole <hi>Office.</hi> And if Devotion be not ſo warm and vigorous in your Soul as it ought, and you would have it to be, you muſt enquire into the Impediments thereof, in order to their ſpeedy remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. Now amongſt the fatal hindrances of Devotion, the Cares of the World are with too great Juſtice chiefly to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd: for they naturally faſten your Thoughts to the Earth, and ſet your Affections on things below; and are as ſo many depreſſing weights upon the Soul, which unluckily keep her from thoſe Tranſports of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which the would ſoar to Heaven. And therefore upon your coming to the Sacrament, you had need to allow your ſelf ſome time wherein to withdraw from worldly Buſineſs, and to caſt off earthly Thoughts, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104696:101"/> by holy Meditation to lift up your Heart unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to give your ſelf unto Prayer; which is indeed the principal inſtance of that Devotion now ſpoken of. And your Prayer muſt at this time be chiefly for <hi>Pardon of by-paſt Sins, for ſtrength againſt them for the future, and that God would grant you all thoſe Graces which he now requires at your hands when you come to the Sacrament.</hi> Be ſure then to be diligent in this Duty: for ſhould your other Endeavours be never ſo vigorous and conſtant, regular and uniform; yet without Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for Gods bleſſing and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you appear to truſt to your own arm, and to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own ſtrength; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that all your ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is from God, that he gives you the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to do well: and therefore unto him direct your Prayer with Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

And though this Judgment may not fall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, (nor ſtraight upon your communicating) yet you know not how ſoon that he that will come may come; and who may abide the day of his coming?

And if you cannot quiet your Conſcience with thoſe excellent Rules there laid down by the Church, but that you require farther counſel and comfort; then ſhe adviſeth you to repair to ſome diſcreet and learned Miniſter of Gods Holy Word, that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit of Abſolution, together with Ghoſtly counſel and advice, to the quieting of your Conſcience, and avoiding of all ſcruple and doubtfulneſs.</p>

                     <p>And this Advice you have good reaſon to embrace, not onely when you come to the Sacrament, but at all other times, when you have any material doubting concerning the ſtate of your Soul: for through a neglect thereof, Time may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe your doubts to feſter, or, what is worſe, you may be tempted to make uſe of deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remedies, and give up your ſelf to thoſe idle and deſperate courſes, which may not onely ſtifle your preſent doubts, but harden you againſt all doubting for the future.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104696:107"/> and at all other times, I would adviſe you not to become your own Caſuiſt, nor to rely upon your own Judgment: for your Soul, if truly humbled, will be apt to deal ſeverely, and to paſs a very hard Sentence upon its Condition: And if it be not truly humbled, it will be ready to handle your Scruple too ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to give too favourable a Conſtruction of your ſtate; and ſo inſtead of ſearching, <hi>skin</hi> over the Wound.</p>

But there will be no ground left for this ſurmiſe, when it is duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that the Perſon to whom you are thus to reveal your ſelf, is a pious and diſcreet Miniſter of Gods Word; one who will be as faithful to conceal, as you are to diſcover your infirmities; and as ready to heal your ſores, as you are to rip them up: one too, who will be ſo far from inſulting over your Weakneſſes, or thinking ill of you for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them, that he will love
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104696:109"/> and encourage your ingenuous and Chriſtian dealing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore you in the Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and help to ſet things at rights between God and your Soul.

And in order to raiſe in, and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you under a due ſenſe of this Unworthineſs, call to mind the ſins you have committed ſince you were laſt at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe you are now come again to repeat and renew that Covenant which thereby you have broken.</p>

                     <p>Be attentive to the actions of the Miniſter; and when you ſee him breaking the Bread, and pouring out the Wine, meditate, <hi>How Chriſts Body was broken, and his Blood ſhed upon the Croſs.</hi> And above all, think with your ſelf, that it was your Sins that drove the Nails into his Hands and Feet, and pierced his bleſſed Side with the Spear: That it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104696:110"/> was your ſins, with the ſins of others, occaſioned all his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the pains of his Body and Soul; and that if he had not ſuffered once upon the Croſs, you had been tormented to <hi>everlaſting Ages.</hi> And upon theſe ſober Thoughts, you will even abhor your ſelf, and with indignation behold your cruel dealing with your Gracious Lord. Conſider too, how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Blood of Chriſt can cleanſe your ſins; and that it doth not, like <hi>Abel</hi>'s, ſpeak for Vengeance, but loudly calls for Mercy upon them who ſpilt it, if they repent and reform; and ſtill draws down Bleſſing upon all who worthily receive it in the Sacrament. Conſider too, how Chriſt by thoſe Sufferings, which are repreſented and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated in the Sacrament, has made an Atonement for your ſins, appeaſed the Wrath,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104696:111"/> and ſatisfi'd the Juſtice of God, which you have provoked and incenſed againſt your Soul. And this will raiſe up your hopes, and make you come with an humble and religious bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Communion; being aſſured, God will not onely there ſeal unto you, but put you in poſſeſſion of the benefits of Chriſts Sufferings; namely, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of your Sins.</p>

And that <hi>Catechiſing</hi> by a more peculiar Energy is thereunto ſubſervient, appears upon this account, that the Church in all Ages has uſed it to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The raiſing up of which <hi>Inſtitution</hi> (ſo diſaſtrouſly faln in our Borders) in hopes of the great edification which thereby will accrue unto this Church, as it was the firſt motive of this Eſſay, ſo it is the laſt Deſign; for which I ſhall think my ſelf largely recompenc'd, if by this contributed <hi>Mite,</hi> I may provoke the more able to caſt richer gifts into the ſame <hi>Corban.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If what I now write of were to be backt with the Example either of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <hi>Infidels</hi> or <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> I could from <hi>a long Converſation with both</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104696:138"/> produce their unwearied care in <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing;</hi> to which I ever thought the paucity of Converts both from <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Romaniſm</hi> ought chiefly to be imputed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> (as in another Diſcourſe I have obſerved) have their <hi>Muſtadarif,</hi> out of which the younger ſort are trained up in the <hi>Principles</hi> of a <hi>Muſſulman.</hi> And the <hi>Jews <hi>Sepher Chinnuck,</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> from being our Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in this particular, are become our <hi>Maſters;</hi> for not only the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> but alſo other <hi>Religious,</hi> glory to have made <hi>Catechiſing</hi> their <hi>Profeſſion;</hi> only with this difference, That the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Catechiſe</hi> the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,</hi> and <hi>other Orders</hi> the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Dull.</hi> But their <hi>Diligence</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in herein firſt ſprang from an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>ours.</hi> For till on <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holy-days</hi> we both preach'd in the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Catechis'd</hi> in the <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104696:138"/> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> did neither.

                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Catechiſing</hi> (as all things elſe, whereof <hi>human</hi> weakneſs hath the Cuſtody and <hi>Government</hi>) is greatly faln from that <hi>Obſervation</hi> which it had once in this <hi>Church;</hi> yet methinks if nothing elſe, this alone ſhould provoke us to a little more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in this <hi>excellent Inſtitution,</hi> to ſee our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> manage it to our <hi>reproach</hi> and damage.</p>

                  <p>THat in the ſame Church and Nation, there ſhould be no leſs Oſtentation and Noiſe of Religion and Holineſs among ſome, than of Profaneneſs and Impiety among others, will prove a matter of no great wonder to ſuch as duly enquire into the cauſes of both: Eſpecially when it is conſidered, that as Ignorance may be the Mother of blind Devotion, ſo it may be likewiſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Preſumption; becauſe all Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among Men, proceeds from the want of a right knowledge of God. And as the Foundation of all true Happineſs, and of all true Religion, which is the proper means of attaining it, grows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom a right Opinion touching things Divine; ſo the miſapprehenſion thereof is the ground of all Miſery, and of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104696:140"/> all thoſe Vices by which it is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                  <p>But that which may juſtly awaken in us a greater wonder, is, to ſee all thoſe Methods proving ineffectual which have been ſo powerfully manag'd for the removal of this pernicious miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; and that we ſhould be ſtill as much under the ſame Diſtempers both in Judgment and Manners, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been adminiſtred for the cure of either. That our own Church in this Age (which for its wickedneſs ſeems to be the laſt) doth make careful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, both for the preſent and future welfare of her Children, is a truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to all that with unprejudiced Minds peruſe her holy Offices, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, Articles, Homilies, Rubricks, and Canons. For how meanly ſoever ſome may think hereof, yet if they were once thoroughly conſidered in their circumſtances, we ſhall find that ſuch a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104696:140"/> there is nothing wanting on the Churches part, that may keep our Actions Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and Sentiments Orthodox.</p>
                  <p>But as in matters of the <hi>Civil State,</hi> many Evils ariſe from a neglect, or remiſs execution of thoſe Laws which are appointed to prevent and ſuppreſs them: So in the Church, a lack of ſeeing her Inſtitutions duly obſerved, when there wanted no circumſtances to exact it, may claim a large ſhare in her preſent Diſorders. For, the letting of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be too looſe, emboldened not a few to break it. However, leaving the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that accrue from this, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom and cold Celebration of the <hi>Divine-Service;</hi> the neglect of guiding Sermons by the Articles; the almoſt utter diſuſage of the Homilies; the lame obſervance of the Rubricks, and ſlight execution of the Canons of the Church: leaving, I ſay, theſe for the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of others, I ſhall only take notice that the omiſſion, or lazy and lukewarm uſe of Catechiſing, ought to be blamed, for much of that Viſciouſneſs and <hi>Error,</hi> which is ſo ſadly viſible both in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Judgment. And I am deeply ingaged in this Perſwaſion, that till publick Catechiſing fall under a diligent, conſtant, and unanimous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104696:141"/> Practice, there is but little likelihood of ever ſeeing that Union and Holineſs, Peace and Truth, flouriſh in this Church, for which ſhe was once ſo famous.</p>
                  <p>Now that thoſe to whom the great charge of Souls is conſigned, may be awaken'd to a little more vigour and diligence in Catechiſing, and that they would ſhake off that Supineneſs, which in this caſe they cannot retain, but to the aggravation of their own Guilt, and the encreaſe of the Churches Miſery: And that every Station of Men, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the Senſe of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> may contribute to the raiſing up of the faln Practice of Catechiſing, is the Deſign and Aim of the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: wherein no Method at all was projected, but every thing ſpoken to as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which being done by a frequent repetition of the ſame thing, Catechiſing is derived from a Word importing the reciprocation of the Voice, after the manner of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho. And in this Senſe it is often to be met with in Secular Authors, from whom it was adopted into Religion, and there retains the ſame Notion and Office. For by Catechiſing, the Church hath always taught the Fundaments and chief Principles of Religion <hi>vivâ voce.</hi> And thoſe that were thus taught, the Greek Writers uſually call <hi>Catechumens,</hi> and the <hi>Latine</hi> Hearers; which might as well reſpect the manner of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as their Fellowſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church: in which they went no further than to be admitted to hear the Principles of <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> made plain unto them. And to Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104696:143"/> thus underſtood, there will be no inconvenience to affirm, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> alluded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. the Ear being as properly the Door of Religion, as of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Science. That Catechiſing was a way of Inſtruction, not to be reſtrain'd to thoſe Catechumens ſo frequently mentioned in Church Hiſtory, and the Ancient Canons; but that all Believers did therein Communicate, will be made good in another Place of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>But if it be doubted whether this be the native meaning of Catechiſing, it then follows that we have recourſe unto the occaſion whence it aroſe. For if Words are notes of that which the Speaker conceiveth, and Conceptions are <hi>Signs</hi> repreſenting that which is ſpoken of; it is neceſſary that he who would rightly underſtand Words, ſhould have recourſe unto the things whence they come. Now the Church (which is Gods School) hath ever uſed Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as a Term of Art; and we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to underſtand it with reſtraint to ſuch matters as the Church is accuſtomed thereby to inſtruct. Following herein the Rule of <hi>Thomas,</hi> that in Words we muſt not ſo much reſpect their original, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and preciſe ſignification and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

For Religion began when God was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Catechiſt, and gave and inſtructed him in that Law; in whoſe obſervation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the main Articles of his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtate of excellent Felicity. In which if he had tarried till he had had an Off-ſpring grown up to a Capacity of a Religious Education, he would, no doubt, have taught them to obſerve that Law, which his Maker for that end had aſſigned him. For we need not be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous to ſuppoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> would have been as careful of his Childrens Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before the Fall, as he was after it. Some traces of whoſe care are to be perceived in his Sons Deportment, when they brought their Offerings to Gods Altar as Teſtimonies of Gratitude and Devotion: Which could not be the effect of meer Natural Inſtinct, but of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Pious Diligence to bring them up Religiouſly.

                     <p>And that this unwritten Law given in Paradiſe, was the <hi>ſix Precepts,</hi> we may conclude from what Mr. <hi>Seldon</hi> tells us out of <hi>Moſche ben Maimon,</hi> who (ſaith he) peremptorily delivers, that the <hi>ſix Precepts were given to the firſt Man from the very beginning of the World.</hi> And therefore ought rather to bear the name of <hi>Adam</hi> than of <hi>Noah;</hi> for the latter can be entitled to them no otherwiſe, than as in him all Mankind was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as in the former they had been begun.

And now the Jews had <hi>eight Precepts</hi> for the Rule of Duties, under which they continued until the time that God at <hi>Mara</hi> gave them a Statute and an Ordinance; and by ſpaces filled up their Ritual.</p>
                     <p>But that which moſt imports the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Subject, is the manner how the <hi>Firſt ſix Precepts</hi> were inſtructed: Which without doubt was <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> or by an Oral Inſtitution: for certainly of <hi>things unwritten,</hi> there can be no other means to inſtil and propagate their knowledg: For notwithſtanding that theſe <hi>Precepts</hi> contain'd ſuch an apparent <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> as could be by none denyed, who therein had once been duly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, yet there was a neceſſity of competent means to procure this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. For let Characters be never ſo large and evident in themſelves, yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104696:148"/> the faireſt Paper cannot exhibit them, till thereon they be duly placed. And if the Soul of Man be at firſt as a <hi>Book</hi> wherein nothing is, and yet every thing may be written; then either <hi>Education</hi> or <hi>Inſtruction, Uſe</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline</hi> muſt of neceſſity fill up this <hi>blank.</hi> And the <hi>Raſa Tabula</hi> of <hi>mans Soul,</hi> as it is moſt ſuſceptive, ſo is it likewiſe moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be firſt Engraven with thoſe things which indiſpenſibly reſpect his Duties toward God and his Neighbour; (the Contents of the <hi>ſix Precepts</hi>) And that the Soul cannot be otherwiſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed therewith, than by <hi>Oral Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> will be granted by all who would not have this <hi>Table</hi> writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt like <hi>thoſe</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> received in the <hi>Mount.</hi>

                     <p>But not to place any ſtrength in this Inſtance, nor in what is obſerved to this Purpoſe, either in the Inſtitution of <hi>Jehoaſh</hi> by <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt, nor what <hi>Solomon</hi> inſinuates concerning himſelf; nor in what the <hi>Rabbins</hi> aſſert of the <hi>many houſes</hi> of <hi>Catechiſm</hi> that were in <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> nor in what ſome write concerning the <hi>Schools of the Prophets,</hi> how that one part of their employment was to Catechize: not placing, I ſay,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104696:149"/> any ſtrength in theſe Inſtances, which might be urged, as they have been, in favour of the Antiquity of <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> I ſhall fix upon that which yields both a more obvious and certain Teſtimony of its Ancientneſs, namely; That the Jews have continually had, and to this day have the practice of <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> by which they introduce their Youth into the knowledg of God, and the Rites of his Worſhip. 'Tis true, there is ſome difference in the time when this Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is begun: For the Ancient Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not to Teach their Children the Principles of their Religion, till they were compleat Thirteen years of Age; but the Modern Jews in the Eaſtern Parts eſpecially, begin much more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And this they do, (as <hi>Aaròn Benetás</hi> a <hi>Sabio</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi> told me) becauſe of their unſettlement, and for fear a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den removal ſhould prevent them in this Duty.</p>
                     <p>It is very remarkable, that no Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of Catechizing appears in the Service of the Temple; which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo wholly Ceremonious, that it may be doubted whether ought of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion (the chief of <hi>Catechiſm</hi>) was therein either thought of or deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Indeed after the Erection of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104696:149"/> there appear great indications, that this way of inſtruction was in no vulgar requeſt: But then in fixing the certain time when theſe Religious Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were Erected, there is ſmall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the <hi>Learned.</hi> That Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues were built before the Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Babylon,</hi> is very uncertain. But after they were returned, it is plain that their Land was full of theſe Houſes dedicated to Gods publick Service: wherein all parts of Divine Worſhip (except Sacrificing) were celebrated. And they may be ſaid to have had that Relation to the Temple, which Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches have now to the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral. But not to diſpute about the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and Quality of Jewiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, that which I would obſerve therein, as moſt agreeable to the thing in hand, is, That Catechizing was (at feaſt) a Principal part of that Teaching, which was therein frequented.

                     <p>Now that the things thus taught were not barely the meer words of the Law, and their naked Reading (as ſome have ſuppoſed,) may be concluded from the good effect and influence which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction had upon the inſtructed. For we find that it preſerved them in the true Worſhip of the true God; which was a work too high to be accompliſhed by ſuch low means, as <hi>naming, ſpelling, joyning Letters</hi> and <hi>Syllables</hi> together, and ſuch other <hi>Abcedarian</hi> and <hi>Grammatical

But when they were returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> though they wanted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet they kept cloſe, and faithfully adhered to the Worſhip of the True God. (Though it muſt not be denyed but that many Corruptions and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodox Conceits were therein retained.) And the Reaſon that hereof is rendered, is, the inſtruction uſed in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues: Whereby they were ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded in what they profeſſed, and ſo firmly and early rooted in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Service of God, that their defection there from was even Morally impoſſible.

                     <p>In <hi>Alexandria, Origen</hi> could not be ſaid to reſtore Catechiſing, for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmed, that there he ſucceeded in <hi>Cathedrâ Catecheticâ</hi> his Maſter <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> as <hi>Clemens</hi> had done his Maſter <hi>Pantenus</hi> in the ſame Chair.

                     <p>So that we ſee how in <hi>Alexandria</hi> (and we may hope that the like was in other Parts) there was a ſucceſſion of <hi>Catechists;</hi> who were alſo called <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſts,</hi> not only becauſe (as <hi>Iſidore</hi> explains the word) by Prayer in the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus they caſt <hi>unclean Spirits</hi> out of thoſe who were poſſeſſed: Nor meerly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Exorciſing the Pagan <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> when they came to be Baptized (as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104696:156"/> is to be ſeen at large in <hi>Burchardus Unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matenſis</hi>) but becauſe that by their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Catechiſing the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, they pulled down Idolatry, and thereby caſt Satan out of his Kingdom, and diſpoſſeſſed him of that Tenor which by Idol-worſhip he had ſo long uſurped. And the firſt part of the Vow of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, binds the Baptized to renounce Idolatry under the name of Devil. That Exorciſing was an Office of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the Ancient Church, and not to be invaded by the <hi>Laity,</hi> is clear out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who in his Book <hi>adverſ. Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. Cap.</hi> 41. tells, how the very Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Women were become ſo ſhameleſs and malepart, that they durſt Teach, Diſpute, Exorciſe, and even Baptiſe.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> makes it a probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was not Penn'd till ſome time after the Goſpel was, and the Church had erected a form of Government, and had Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted among other things, an Order of Inſtruction, or <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> in which both the Adult Converts, and Children of Believers were to be Taught: And he further adds, that thoſe Principles men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. had reſpect unto the uſual and eſtabliſhed form of <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> Now if this conjecture be argumentative, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104696:156"/> to its proper place, there will need no more to prove Catechiſing to be of Apoſtolical Inſtitution and Practice.</p>

                     <p>BUt ſuppoſe that all which has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been obſerved be not evident, nay, that nothing of this way of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ever in uſe with the Primitive Inſtructors of Chriſtianity, which would be a very uncouth ſuppoſal; yet this doth only conclude againſt the Age, but not the convenience of <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> It no way proves that ſuch a way of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had not been highly rational, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ignorant Infidels into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the true Faith. For all thoſe who by ordinary means were to be converted to Chriſtian Religion, were no leſs ignorant of its Principles, than thoſe Infants who are born within the Church; and therefore to be Catechiſed therein, was as proper and requiſite for them, as for theſe: For the ignorance of the one,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104696:157"/> as well as of the other, was to be removed by ſuch means as all diſcreet <hi>Teachers</hi> have thought ſuitable to that end.</p>
                     <p>Now it is obvious to every Capacity, that no Mans ignorance can be removed by <hi>Rhetoricating Harangues, Pompous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, profound Reſearches,</hi> &amp;c. But by humble and plain Leſſons: Eaſie and obvious Rules: And ſuch <hi>A. b. c.</hi> Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as fall under the comprehenſion of the rude and unlearned; and which are proper to prepare them for higher Leſſons. In brief, though the things which are taught be in themſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and difficult, yet the manner of Teaching them muſt be humble and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. And this way of inſtruction was (no doubt) purſued by the Primitive Doctors, who did not only prepare by Catechiſing the ruder Infidel to receive Baptiſm, but did alſo by the ſame courſe build up and educate thoſe into a more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſtianity, whom they had already Baptiſed. And therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>And this makes Catechiſing highly convenient in reſpect of the true Method of learning: For therein is obſerved the natural path of inſtruction, which ever
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104696:157"/> begins with ſhort and obvious notions, to the end the Learner may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with a difficult and perplexed entrance. For if the minds of Novices, or young Diſciples, ſhould be loaden and puzzled with multitude and variety, or with obſcureneſs and prolixity of Rules, they would be in danger to reject the whole Inſtitution, for the irkſome painfulneſs of its firſt Grounds. And albeit that all beginnings are attended with Hardſhips: Yet they ought in all reaſon to be reduced to as great an eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as their Nature will afford; to the end that they may not diſhearten the Undertaker. This we ſee is the courſe of all Arts and Sciences, both Liberal and Mechannick, which have their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductive and Initiatory Syſtems, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch eaſie Elements as being firſt known, fit the <hi>Learner</hi> for deeper Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments. And theſe lower Rudiments hold ſome reſemblance with that leſſer ſize of Vertues, which ſome <hi>Platoniſts</hi> call Purgative, becauſe they are firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Soul to cleanſe and prepare her for the reception of <hi>Greater.</hi> And in Religion it is as requiſite as in human Arts, that the firſt Leſſons be framed according to the weak and ſlender Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of youngeſt <hi>Beginners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:104696:158"/>
                     <p>Now as there is ſmall probability that in Writing he ſhould ever be able to give the true proportion of Words, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learned the firſt <hi>draught</hi> of <hi>Letters:</hi> So there is no great aſſurance, that any one ſhould make any ſolid and firm Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the Myſteries of Chriſtianity, who was never acquainted with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples thereof: or, That thoſe ſhould be able to give any good account of the hope that is in them, who never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> on which their hope is founded.</p>
                     <p>And this is a Clue that leads us to the right way of grounding Religion: for by what is ſaid, it is eaſie to perceive, that ſolid Catechiſing is to the orderly Structure of <hi>Spiritual Knowledge,</hi> what a ſure Foundation is to any material Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. And therefore he that would edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf, or others, in Chriſtianity, without this Ground-work, build but a Viſionary Church, or a Houſe upon the Sand. As hath been ſadly viſible in thoſe Perſons who being not founded upon this Rock, have been quickly ſhaken and blown down with every Wind of <hi>Corrupt Doctrine,</hi> vented by Men crafty to contrive deceit. It being impoſſible that thoſe ſhould be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in ſuch Principles of Religion,

                     <p>And here in the Firſt place, it cannot be denyed, how that the generality of the People of this Kingdom, have for many Years (at leaſt during the time of our Inteſtine Wars) either been deſtitute of all Catechiſing, or have been Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed only in ſuch Principles, as were good for nothing but to eſtabliſh the Elder in a curſed Schiſm and Rebellion, and to infect the Younger with the ſame Contagion. The ſad effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſtill viſible in the unpeaceable Tenets of ſome, and in the want of a due underſtanding of Religion in moſt. In reſpect of which, we have need to be taught again, which be the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Oracles of God; being become ſuch as have need of Milk, and not of ſtrong Meat. The greateſt part of the common People, being ſo far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reap any benefit from the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of abſtruſer Myſteries in Eloquent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104696:163"/> and Elaborate Diſcourſes, (which is ſo ſtudiouſly purſued by our <hi>Junior</hi> and <hi>Florid Theologues</hi>) that they want inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the plaineſt parts of <hi>Catechiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Doctrines. For notwithſtanding that we boaſt much of our Knowledge of Chriſt, and that our Proficiency is ſo great in Religion, that we conceive our ſelves wiſer than our Teachers; yet if the Tree may be judged by its Fruits, we ſhall be found ſhamefully ignorant of what we aſſume to know, and to have little of that Wiſdom which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from above, which Chriſt came to teach and infuſe, and which is Pure, Peaceable, Gentle, eaſie to be entreated, merciful, without Hypocriſie and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering.</p>
                     <p>In the Second place, we cannot but with deep Reſentments obſerve, that ſince the time God turned again our Captivity, and reſtored this Church to the free uſe of his Ordinances, Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing has met but with cold Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even from thoſe by whom it ought to have been moſt lovingly careſſed. For in moſt places it has been looked upon rather as a Foreigner, than a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Church; and as Fruits of their Mouth, never in Seaſon but for a few Days in <hi>Lent:</hi> And even then too,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104696:163"/> the <hi>Church-Catechiſm</hi> is generally taught, without any ſuch explanation as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in reſpect of thoſe ſlender Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to whoſe inſtruction it is chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted.</p>

                     <p>And as for the Firſt ſort, namely, the diſobedient and refractory (who are now known by the very candid Name of <hi>Diſſenters</hi>) they cannot pretend to a more plauſible excuſe of their Unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, than that they were never du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104696:165"/> to be a clear and perſpicuous Rule of what we are to do both toward God and our Neighbour.</p>
                     <p>And a Man that is well grounded in the Doctrine of the Firſt Commandment, knows, that he muſt reſerve all Divine Honour, Truſt, Devotion to God alone, and that he may beſtow no part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon the Creature; and therefore cannot but avoid and abhor thoſe <hi>Romiſh Doctors</hi> that would make him a Client to the Saints, and a conſtant Votary to the Bleſſed Virgin and his Guardian Spirit. He that is well grounded in the Doctrine of the Second Commandment, will never be induced to believe, that the Image is to be adored with the ſame Worſhip that is due to what is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: He will be wary of admitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bodily repreſentations of the Holy Trinity: and look jealouſly upon all the Doctrine of Image worſhip, which he ſees to be vindicated with a few remote and ſuſpicious Diſtinctions, deviſed by the Fathers of that Doctrine on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to maintain its Credit.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104696:165"/> that frequent Curſing and Swearing, if cuſtomary, is Venial, or a Sin which is pardonable in its own Nature, and for which the Favour of God cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited: That equivocating in Oaths is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>awful: That our moſt Solemn Oaths may be diſpenſed with: That the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Name of God may be uſed in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable exorcization of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: That Underſtanding and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not neceſſarily required to our Invocations upon God. He that has been throughly informed of the mind of its eternal Author in the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, will never give up himſelf to a Religion that prefers a Mans Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods, or a Saints Day before the Lords: Which would alter the Inſtitution of God himſelf, as was deſigned by Pope <hi>Silveſter,</hi> who decreed that Thurſday ſhould be kept for the Lords Day. He that hath well learned the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, muſt do great Violence to his Underſtanding, before he can chuſe to be of a Religion that loves to drink the Blood of princes: That abſolves Subjects from their Allegiance to their Lawful Sovereign: That gives Power to a Vicar to depoſe Princes at Pleaſure: That Arms Subjects with Power to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their King. The like may be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104696:166"/> ſaid of all the Precepts of the Royal Law of God, which is the moſt perfect Rule of our Obedience, and which we are Taught to violate, ſo ſoon as we have given up our ſelves to Popery, and to the Service of the <hi>Roman Moloch.</hi> And though theſe are Myſteries which the <hi>Romiſh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers</hi> carefully conceal, and ſometime zealouſly inveigh againſt, while they are compaſſing <hi>eaſie Proſelytes,</hi> with whom they deal in the moſt ſpecious Pretences; yet they have no ſooner deluded them to give up their Names to Popery, and thereupon to ſhake Hands with all liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judging for themſelves, than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they let them know what is to be done. And if they ſtartle at doing what is commanded them, this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cenſured for a Relick of their <hi>Old Hereſie,</hi> and that there was ſomething wanting in their Converſion, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſupplied, but by acting throughly all the moſt horrible Injunctions of their New Faith.</p>
                     <p>And by the ſame means of being well Catechiſed in the Lords Prayer, a Man will be able to apprehend and reject the many Errors Popery would impoſe upon him in that high concern. For thereby he will clearly perceive that Prayer ought be made to God only, and that none to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104696:166"/> can ſhare with him in that, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of Divine and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And that for this reaſon he ought not to embrace a Religion which enjoyns him to pray unto Saints and Angels, and that too not only to have them intercede to God for him, but alſo to help him in his Neceſſities, and to deliver him both in Bodily and Ghoſtly Dangers. And that this may not be thought the fault of Roſaries, Hours, and Books of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions (for which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is accountable, as having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them by her Authority) it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Tenor of her <hi>publick Service:</hi> as is plainly to be ſeen in the Collects, Hymns, and Litanies of that Breviary which was reſtored by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and authoriſed by ſeveral Popes, and which is at this day in uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable uſe through all the Papal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p>And we might alſo obſerve the like concerning the Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which whoſoever is once ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed according to the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of this Church, will quickly diſcern the Abuſes thereinto introduced by Popery. To mention no more than what belongs to the Author of a Sacrament; which our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> aſſerts, and which is an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104696:167"/> undeniablle Truth, to be only Chriſt. And therefore all thoſe things are to be excluded the number of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are not of his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and clear appointment. And that <hi>Orders, Penance, Confirmation, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Extream Unction</hi> (all Romiſh Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments) are not of Chriſt's Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is eaſily diſcernable to Men but ſlenderly verſed in the Holy Bible; and therefore not to be received for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Chriſt, but Inventions of thoſe, who teach for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men. Now by theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect intimations we may ſafely infer, That thoſe who have had their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Religion ſurely laid according to the publickly allowed <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of this Church, muſt have other Ends to ſerve than thoſe of Religion, and drive other projects than Gods Honour, and their own Salvation, who forſake her Communion for that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to return: What ever hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily contributed to our Revolting to the one hand or the other from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Religion of this Church, there is none that will deny but that the lack of a plain and ſolid Catechiſing has had therein a very large ſhare. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may conlude, That the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104696:167"/> practice of that, will be a chief means to reſtore Union and Peace, the Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof hath occaſioned the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: And indeed, Catechiſing ſeems the only proper way not only to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thoſe that do ſtand, but to raiſe up thoſe that are faln; if we conſider how ineffectual all other ways have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which have been managed to this end. Which now come to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104696:168"/> had left behind them. It needs not be demonſtrated, that our frowardneſs and opiniaſtrè are not to be cured by ſuch Methods: But that which I would chiefly take notice of, is, that <hi>Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> which out of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableneſs that they are generally thought to bear to our diſtempers, and the powerfulneſs of their management, have obtained a <hi>Name</hi> to be the only proper remedies. But the continuance of the Malady, is a convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that theſe are not ſo proper for this purpoſe, as is ſo generally ſuppoſed. And give me leave to ſpeak of theſe two freely; and firſt of Diſputation, which is a meer empyrick preſcription in order to heal our preſent diſtempers. For though Diſputation, as it is managed by the Pen, may have got a great Vogue in the World, yet we can never hope that our <hi>Diſſenting Judgments</hi> ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be reconciled, if with due ſeriouſneſs we conſider; Firſt, the manner of their conduct: Secondly, the matter to be diſputed: Thirdly, the perſons thereby to be wrought upon.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt, If the conduct of diſputes fall under a calm, unprejudiced and reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive review, (as they appear in Print) the Pen-men thereof ſeem to have intended
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104696:168"/> rather the defamation, than conviction of each other; and to have been of an opinion that men were to be refuted, as <hi>Mercury</hi> of old was worſhipt, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dirt and ſtones in their Face. But we have been taught by miſerable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the laſhing of a <hi>Few,</hi> hath been ſubſervient to no better end than to exaſperate the <hi>whole Party:</hi> And that our keeneſt Arguments, if we may judge by the Event, have only ſerved to alarm the Adverſary into a better proviſion for future reſiſtance, and to ſtrengthen their opinion in that part wherein the <hi>Attack</hi> had diſcovered it to be the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. But grant (as indeed we muſt) that the Diſſenters (to whom this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph chiefly relates) are not able to ſtand in Argument before their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; yet we muſt alſo grant, that there is a want of <hi>Decorum</hi> in the Victors carriage, while his Argument loſeth its efficacie, through the looſeneſs, luxury, or rigour of its expreſſion. For it is too apparent to conceal, that there are ſo many unmanly reflections in moſt of our late Controverſies, that diſcreet and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber perſons loath the reading of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges where they occur. Which gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for doubting that ſuch arguings ſo managed, proceed not from that <hi>Spirit of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104696:169"/> meekneſs wherewith the overtaken Brother ſhould be reſtored;</hi> nor were deſigned to procure Unity and Concord among us, ſeeing that ſo little of that <hi>Charity</hi> can therein be diſcerned, which is the bond of Peace, and ſure ground-work of all true Reconcilement. And if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our <hi>Debates</hi> were throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, we might find this Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining like the Eagle in the Greek Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, which ſeeing her Breaſt wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a feather'd Dart, cryed out with Tears, Alas! my own kind hath deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. But to proceed.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be doubted, but that ſome opinions ſooner die by being contemn'd, than taken notice of. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that this <hi>National Church</hi> is now troubled with many Opinions which long ere this would have found their own Graves, if they had not been kept alive with oppoſition. In ſo much that it may be ſaid of this particular Church, what was of the Catholick, That if ſhe had ſtopt and damn'd up the Originals and Springs of Controverſies, rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining for one part, to give them as it were a Pipe and Conduit to convey them to Poſterity, ſhe had not ſuffer'd that Inundation of Opinions with which at this day ſhe is over-run. A policy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104696:169"/> ſtill in practice in the Popiſh Countries, where thoſe Books of Controverſies are ſcarce to be met with, wherein their Religion is maintained againſt Reformed Churches. By which means they live free from thoſe Diſſentions wherewith their Neighbours are afflicted, to their ſcandal and ruin: And I hope we may ſafely imitate their <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> whoſe <hi>Errors</hi> we abhor.</p>
                     <p>But if Controverſies were as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as by ſome they are pretended to be, yet their conduct ought ſo far to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as that at leaſt there be a ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from hoſtile Expreſſions, which have hitherto been of no better uſe than to exaſperate Men into a petulant and peeviſh vindication of that <hi>Name,</hi> under which they conceived themſelves to be reviled. Next, that the Diſputers would not vent and foam out their perſonal Piques and Animoſities under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and cloke of aſſerting <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> Laſtly, that they would aim at Peace and not Revenge. For how ſeemly ſoever the preſent carriage of Diſputes may be accounted in perſons of another Character, yet it is very ill-becoming thoſe who are ſtiled <hi>Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Reconcilation,</hi> and who ought to expreſs the Emphaſis of that Title, in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104696:170"/> reconciling Mens Wills with their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and their Underſtandings with the Truth; in bringing the wicked to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the malicious to Charity; and to win all to a holy compliance with the deſign and Rule of the Bleſſed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Chriſtianity; which was, to heighten our Converſation to the moſt elevated pitch of true Vertue, Peace, and Holineſs; and that our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould exceed all theirs that ever went before us.</p>

                     <p>That theſe and the like things are proper for Catechiſm, and thereby the moſt gently and indiſcernably to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, none I preſume will gainſay. For they naturally fall in with thoſe Truths which belong to our duty toward man, of which we muſt be duly informed, ere we can therein be exact.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſſenter yield an obedient ear to this Inſtruction, there will be little fear of his continuing ſcrupulous to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey what his Superiors have a juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and right to enjoyn: If he do not hearken, then let him be devoted to the Civil Power, and leave the Magiſtrates to vindicate their own Authority; and to make that be done for <hi>Wrath,</hi> which would not for <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And I am tempted to think, that if at the <hi>Happy Reſtauration</hi> this way had been purſued, we long ere this had been ſenſible of its good Effects. And I will add this more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104696:171"/> That if the Orthodox Clergy, ever ſince God wonderfully reſtored them, had devoted the greateſt ſhare of their pains to plain Expoſitions and Paraphraſes of the Church-Catechiſm, they might long before this have gently gained both upon their Opinions and Affections, who (by the indiſcretion of other Methods) ſeem to be now alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated beyond retrieve. Conſcience of Obedience will anſwer all the Scruples of Minds diſpoſed to Peace; and for the Turbulent let them be anſwer'd with Rods and Axes.</p>

                        </gap>ous for no more than what will ſave us. Now theſe are both few and plain. For as for thoſe numerous places of Scripture, Notices of Oral Tradition, which are da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And things thus truly neceſſary, are as few as plain: St. <hi>Paul</hi> has reduced
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104696:172"/> them to Two Articles: To believe that God is, and that he is a Rewarder of all them that come unto him. And to whom only thus much is given, it ſhall not be damnable that they believe no more. And if this (as it ſeems to) be the loweſt degree of Faith, God will therewith be pleaſed, if the means be wanting of riſing higher. <hi>Cornelius</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. who becauſe of his Alms and Prayers was accepted of God, had not been ſafe in that State, had he gone no further, after God had ſent St. <hi>Peter</hi> to inform him what he was to do more. The Charities and Devotions performed in the time of his Jewiſh Proſelytiſm, how far they might have ſtood him in ſtead, had he been vouchſafed no farther <hi>Illumination,</hi> is not the Queſtion; yet if he had ſtaid there, when means of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther was afforded him, or if he had refuſed to believe in Chriſt after a ſufficient Revelation, he had then juſtly incurred the condemnation of loving <hi>Darkneſs</hi> more than <hi>Light,</hi> when Light was come unto him. Theſe inſtances are uſual in this matter, and tell us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That as few Articles are of abſolute neceſſity, yet that their number is not the ſame unto all, ſome more, ſome leſs, as God hath given to every man, all
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104696:172"/> that is neceſſary for a Man to believe, which for that purpoſe is ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him, and which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him to believe and practiſe. But there is none can ſet down how much every man ſhould believe, no more than he can ſet down how much every man ſhould eat.</p>
                     <p>But if notwithſtanding this paucity and plainneſs of the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, any ſhould therein be ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, this Evil is not to be removed by Diſputation, but plain Catechiſing; whereby the Myſteries of Faith, and the Duties of Holy Life are to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For Catechiſm is a brief and plain Inſtitution appointed for that end; and it takes care that the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be made ſo eaſie, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt capacity may apprehend them; and yet in ſo conciſe and ſhort a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the weakeſt Memory may not therefore be ſurcharged.</p>

                     <p>IN the laſt place, it will not a little import the clearing of the preſent ſubject, to enquire into the nature of Diſputes, and their Capacities who ſhould thereby be wrought upon. As to the former, it will ſuffice to obſerve, that Diſputation muſt be guided by <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> which when mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the greateſt plainneſs whereof they are capable, fall ſhort of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs and familiarity, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Catechiſm. And as to the latter, it is very remarkable, 1. That the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and common People make incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the greater number of <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> 2. That the Underſtandings of ſuch are uſually heavy, groſs, and dull, as ſymbolizing with their Callings and Conditions; and by conſequent, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to comprehend any profound and learned concluſions. And what is yet more conſiderable, the greateſt part of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have no clear underſtanding
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104696:173"/> of the very Errors which a <hi>Logical Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> would confute. The moſt of them being ignorant of their own Opinions, and of the things againſt which they have imbib'd a ſecret and ſpiteful preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. For it was, and is ſtill the policy of thoſe who ſeduce the Vulgar into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Schiſm, not to acquaint them further with the Opinions they were to abet, than to let them ſee that they were contrary to what they diſliked in the Church. Inſomuch that the poor Vulgar being deluded into <hi>Separation,</hi> retain but a very confuſed and imperfect Notion of what with great impetuouſneſs they ſtrive both for and againſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be a very Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enterpriſe, to go to confute their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors with depth of Argument, who are in a great meaſure ignorant of the very Errors themſelves, and who do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly know the opinions whereof they are to be convinced. The caſe of ſuch people much reſembling theirs, whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought to ſtand in need of Milk, and not of ſtrong Meat; of a <hi>Catechiſm</hi> and not a <hi>Controverſie;</hi> and to be taught Chriſtianity from the very beginning. And the ſame Author being to confute thoſe miſcreant Hereticks, who ſaid the Reſurrection was already paſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104696:174"/> gave themſelves to lewd living; he did it not with the heat and briskneſs of a Diſputant, but with the gravity and moderation of an Apoſtle: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving barely and calmly named the wild Opinions, he poſitively and plainly laid down thoſe Truths that confronted them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 11.18, 19. And he would have the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> Hereticks to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with Eccleſiaſtick Cenſures or Diſcipline, and not Diſputings, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cometh envy, ſtrife, railings, evil ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                     <p>If we were to ſet down the ſeveral <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Perſwaſions</hi> of all the Chriſtians in the World, they will be found to agree in more than is purely and ſimply neceſſary to Salvation. And it may ſeem very vain to diſpute and quarrel about the reſt. And therefore the whole buſineſs may be reſolved into a diligent, ſincere, and plain <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> how we ought to practiſe what we all acknowledge to be true; and to fall cloſe to doing thoſe duties which are unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, and of univerſal acceptance. To perform what in Baptiſm we vowed, and live what we profeſs to believe. To make our ſelves fit to be juſtified, and not waſte time in controverting all the particulars that are made to relate to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104696:174"/> Juſtification. There is a knowledge in Religion which many earneſtly purſue, without which thouſands have entered into happineſs. We need ſeek for no more therein, than will perform the great work of Salvation, and bring us to the <hi>end of our Hope.</hi> And all this is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt aſſuredly to be had in our own <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or we have been moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly impoſed upon.</p>
                     <p>But before we diſmiſs this Topick, there are a few things more, chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the perſons to be converted; which methinks ought to give Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing precedency of Controverſie in that affair. And the firſt thing is the long ſtanding of the Errors: For if the perſon has ſuck'd them in with his Milk, and been therewith at the firſt ſeaſon'd, then there is Education in the caſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe account alone not a few ſtick cloſe both to truth and falſhood: and if their Anceſtors have lived and died, and they have been brought up in ſuch a perſwaſion, it is, and indeed ought to be hard to remove it. One main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Pagans were ſo backward to entertain Chriſtianity, was its enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to renounce thoſe Inſtitutions wherein they had been educated, and their Fore-fathers had lived, and thought
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104696:175"/> themſelves ſecure and happy. And <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi> derided <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> for a man of an eaſie Perſwaſion, and too much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, becauſe he forſook <hi>Plato</hi> and embraced Chriſt. And <hi>Caecilius</hi> in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius Felix,</hi> would have his <hi>Antiſtes Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis,</hi> a firm adherent to the Principles which his Anceſtors had delivered him. And they whoſe Pens were ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently employed in confutation of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm, have generally complained that their greateſt ſweat was to pull down the <hi>ſtrong hold</hi> of Education; it being become the laſt refuge of Gentiliſm, out of which they would not be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: For they reſolutely retained what they had received from their Anceſtors. For both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Mahumetan</hi> are at this day of the ſame Opinion: For the former makes preſcription his Religion; and thinks it enough to out-face all Arguments brought againſt it, becauſe ſo many Rabbies live and die therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the latter has recourſe to his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and thinks himſelf ſecure in what he doth, becauſe he follows the Footſteps of thoſe many Cenerations that went before him. Indeed, all men are willing to die in the Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were born. And <hi>Caecilius</hi>'s <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus credere</hi> goes far with Chriſtians, as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104696:175"/> well as others; the firſt ſeaſoning being incomparably more prevailing than any ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Now, if thoſe evil Opinions are to be removed, in which we have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; it can never be ſo well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by tearing them down with the ſtrength of Logick, as by inſtilling ſuch eaſie Principles, neceſſary and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted points, with ſimplicity and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as of themſelves will ſubvert the Errors of the firſt Inſtruction, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the foundation of future Peace and Truth. And no way of teaching can ſo naturally be hereunto entituled as Catechiſing. For as to Diſputation, it is generally had under a jealous aſpect, as being thought ſubtle and reaching, and intended rather to celebrate a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And as for Preaching, a new Chapter will manifeſtly make it appear not to be ſo proper for this purpoſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> moſt imagine. But in Catechiſing there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s ſuch an honeſt ſimplicity, clear and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104696:176"/> plain way of procedure, that none can therein ſuſpect any Sophiſm or <hi>artificial dealing,</hi> diſguiſes or ſhadowings.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, moſt men are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo modeſt in the apprehenſion of their own abilities, or ſo fearful to be enſnared in the great concerns of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they are unwilling to depend upon their own judgments in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, eſpecially which they ſee are moſt diſputed and queſtioned. And therefore they think it no ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to forſake an Opinion, becauſe they cannot anſwer all the Objections, which by the ſubtle Advocate of a different Perſwaſion are brought againſt it. And ſo long as a man can really believe that there are others who can anſwer what is objected againſt his Opinion, he will never quit it, becauſe he cannot anſwer it himſelf. For to think an Argument cannot be anſwered, becauſe not by me, were to think the Lady muſt be carried by none, becauſe neither A. nor B. can win her; as if there were no more men in the world ſufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but they two.</p>
                     <p>But if Diſputation ſhould be able to force men from theſe refuges, and to caſt away the groundleſ, Opinions they embrace; yet if their Opinions twiſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104696:176"/> with ſome worldly Intereſt, and yield any ſecular advantage; if the Opiniatres can ſay, <hi>By this craft we get our wealth;</hi> then great is <hi>Diana,</hi> and your Argument is anſwered.</p>

                     <p>We might here alſo add, how Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels in Chriſtian Religion contradict the Errand whereon it was ſent into the World, which was for Love and Peace; to reconcile men to God, and among themſelves. And if it yield contrary Fruits, they come as the Tares among the Wheat, by the craft and malice of the wicked One. For Strifes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies are no more the effects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than of the Law: Were all men juſt and honeſt, we needed not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Aſhes of a moth eaten Statute; and had we no Self-ends and Intereſts, no baſe paſſions and deſigns, the itch of Diſputation would not diſquiet and make us ſo reſtleſs.</p>
                     <p>Before we cloſe up this Chapter, it will not be much impertinent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how Diſputation was at firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Reformation an excellent Engine to advance it: And we find that the Reformers made importunate ſuits for publick Audience and Judgment; and the offer of open Diſputation greatly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the People of the ſoundneſs of their Cauſe, when they ſaw they were ready to put it upon publick Tryal. And more may be ſuppoſed to have followed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104696:177"/> the firſt Eſſays of the Reformation, out of an Opinion that it was good and true, being defended with ſuch freedom, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and aſſurance, than by the ſtrength of thoſe Arguments which were at firſt brought to aſſert it. But then it is to be conſidered that the Reformers offer'd this kind of tryal to thoſe with whom they began to be at no leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than with members of a diſtinct and different Communion; and in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they were in hope to gain, but in no danger to loſe Proſelytes. For they wiſely invaded the Adverſary in his own Country, and challeng'd him to a Diſpute in his own <hi>Cities,</hi> and in the throng of his Adherents. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how different Terms Diſputes can now be managed, either with Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or the common Enemy, I leave the truly conſiderate to determine. But ſince we are reſolved to fight, I could wiſh our valour were more diſcreet, than to encounter the Enemy within our own Bowels; to controvert our Religion in the place where it is legally eſtabliſhed. A thing not heard of in other Countries, where there is a greater Peace and more outward Religion. But I ſhall cloſe up this Topick with ſetting down what is uſually obſerved upon this Subject, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:104696:178"/>1. That Religion is like neither to get nor ſave by Diſputes. 2. That Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes on this ſubject may have the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luck to make ſome ſuſpect the truth of all Religion, becauſe it is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted. For weaker Heads ſeeing the Roof totter, are apt to ſuſpect there is no firmneſs in the foundation; and to conclude nothing is certain, if any thing be queſtion'd. 3. That in ſo great a miſt of Diſputes, many may grow halting and luke-warm, and think it their only ſafety to ſtand ſtill, or ſit down in Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality. 4. That for one ſin Diſputes have cured, they have begot innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 5. That the ſtrength and practice of Religion have been ſenſibly impaired, ſince by the diſtemper'd heats of Mens Spirits it hath been rarified into ſubtil Controverſies. 6. That ſuſpence of Judgment, and exerciſe of Charity were ſafer and ſeemlier for Chriſtian men, than the hot purſuit of thoſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, wherein they that are moſt fervent to diſpute, are not always the moſt able to determine. But what is more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the preſent purpoſe, it ſhould ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be conſidered, That the People are neither to be confuted of their falſe, nor eſtabliſhed in the true Notices of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by <hi>Doubtful Diſputes,</hi> but <hi>plain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſtical
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104696:178"/> Doctrines.</hi> And as to our ſelves of this Church, ſeeing there can come nothing of our Contentions, but the mutual waſte of the parties contending, till a common Enemy dance in the Aſhes of us both; I ſhall ever wiſh, and moſt heartily pray, that the ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Peace and Unity, ſo frequent in the Goſpel, may at the laſt ſo prevail in this Nation, to the burying and utter oblivion of ſtrife, together with the cauſes that have either bred or brought it up: That things of ſmall moment ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver disjoyn them, whom one God, one Lord, one Faith, one Spirit, one Baptiſm, bands of ſo great force, have linked together: That a reſpective Eye towards things wherewith we ſhould not be diſquieted, make us not unable to ſpeak peaceably one to another. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that no ſtrife may ever be heard of again, but who ſhall hate ſtrife moſt, and purſue peace with the ſwifteſt paces.</p>

                     <p>HAving in the antecedent Chapter diſcharged Diſputes and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies from being any ſuitable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means of reducing the Diſſenters of our own Church, or winning the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Roman: The next thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to our healing is Preaching, which I here take to be <hi>An open, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and Authoritative publication of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries.</hi> And this the Church doth two ſeveral ways: 1. As a Witneſs. 2. As an Expoſitor.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, The Church Preacheth as a Witneſs, by publick reading the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, and by relating and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying the Divine Truths which God in the inſpired Volumes hath conſigned her. And that this is no ſpurious ſenſe of Preaching, we have him to aſſure us, who well underſtood the ſenſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance both of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Thing.</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:104696:179"/> For in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. the reading of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the Synagogues every Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the genuine and native ſignification of the Word, ſtyled Preaching. That this Preaching of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> was a naked reading of his Law, we have a whole cloud of Expoſitors to atteſt it, beſides the clearneſs of the thing it ſelf. But I cannot be of their judgment who aſſert, That neither the Ancient nor Modern Jews had any ſuch thing as weekly Preaching upon any part of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground ſolely conclude the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be meer reading. For we find that the Old Jews had divers Men among them, who uſed to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their Talents to the Expoſition of the Leſſon that was read: and theſe in ordinary courſe were the Sons or Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Prophets, who were trained up in learning of the Law, and at the age of Thirty received the Title of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; and till they obtained the Grace of immediate Inſpiration, or the Spirit of Propheſie, they continued to expound the Scriptures (not by Revelation, but) according to that knowledge which the ordinary bleſſing of God upon their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies was able to compaſs. Anſwerable whereunto (as ſome think) was that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104696:180"/> cuſtom among the Chriſtians, mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29. And alſo thoſe Diſciples of the Prophets of the New Teſtament called Doctors, becauſe they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to teach in the Church. But for mine own part, I rather underſtand the Word Doctor in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of all ſuch Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters as had abilities of Preaching and Teaching the People in their Aſſemblies. And that Presbyters and Doctors were all one, we may conclude from <hi>Tertull. de Preſcript. c.</hi> 3. <hi>Quid ergò ſi Epiſcopus,</hi> &amp;c. What then if a Biſhop, if a Deacon, if a Widow, a Virgin, if a Doctor, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Martyr ſhall fall from the Rule? In this Catalogue of principal Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Orders, Presbyters muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Doctors, unleſs we will deny them to have any room among the chief Ranks of the Church; which were both falſe and abſurd. And that inceſtuous perſon, with an Opinion of whom the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were puft up, was (as is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theoderet</hi>) one of their Doctors, that is, one of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that Church, that exerciſed the Office of Preaching, and by that means bore a great ſway among the People,</p>
                     <p>But to return to the <hi>reading of Moſes,</hi> which began with the Moral Service of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104696:180"/> the Synagogue; when we find that the Moſaical Law was diſtinguiſhed into Diviſions anſwerable to the number of Weeks in the Year, that the whole Law in that ſpace might be read over: corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to which Leſſons out of the Law, there were others out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: one of which the Holy Jeſus took for his Subject at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> when after the manner of the Jewiſh Doctors he made his Expoſition, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. And he did the like, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.35. where he is ſaid to teach [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] in the Synagogue; which might be done without any pretenſion to ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as was ſuppoſed in <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; which in the Chriſtian uſe of the word in the New Teſtament differs from Teaching. Chriſt did both, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.35. He taught the Law, and preacht the Goſpel: At Thirty years old he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Doctor (before which time the ancient Church made none Presbyters) and at the ſame time he preacht the Goſpel of the Kingdom. But ſtill the matter is plain enough, that the bare reading of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, is Preaching in the proper mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which ſort of Preaching is ſtill practiſed in the appointed Leſſons of the Church. The former out of the Old
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104696:181"/> Teſtament, being derived like many wholeſom things from the Synagogue; and the Second Leſſon out of the New Teſtament, which was appointed, as moſt ſuppoſe, by the 16th Canon of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> celebrated in the year of Grace 364. Albeit <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> (who lived in the Second Age) ſeems to give the Leſſons an elder date. For in his ſecond Apology, he tells us, how all thoſe who abide in Cities, and the adjacent Countries, meet in one place, on the day called Sunday; and the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Memoires and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Apoſtles, together with the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Writings of the Prophets are read unto them, as far as the time and occaſion ſerves: And that the Reader ceaſing, the Preſident in a Speech makes an Exhortation that they would imitate thoſe good things which had been read. From which it is evidently to be concluded, that the Church in the firſt and beſt Ages of Chriſtianity preacht as a Witneſs, when ſhe read, and thereby atteſted the truth of the Holy Scriptures. And all men are in ſome degree capable thereby to be edified. For there is none underſtands the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo well, but he may improve by hearing them read in the Church. And
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104696:181"/> if we look into the Efficacy of the <hi>Word,</hi> it is wonderful that it ſhould be leſs as it is read, than as it is expounded; ſeeing that the one is the Word of God as it was inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and the other can no farther be ſo accounted, than as it keeps cloſe to the ſenſe and meaning thereof; which is not ſo eaſie, ſo long as Men are ſubject to Errors and Miſtakes, and have baſe Ends to ſerve, and carnal Circumſtances to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But becauſe all men ought to have ſuch a knowledge in God's Word as may be ſufficient to Salvation: and becauſe all will not attain to ſo much by bare reading thereof, therefore the Church Preacheth as an Expoſitor, by diſcovering and explaining what in Sacred Scripture is myſterious and obſcure; and by a ſeaſonable application of thoſe things which are more obvious and evident. And in this ſenſe Preaching is an Office in our own Church, which cannot be too highly magnified, nor too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated, if it be agreeable to thoſe Homilies which were intended, not only to ſupply thoſe who have not the Gift of Preaching, ſufficiently to inſtruct the people committed to their Cure; but alſo to be a wholſom Rule, by which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104696:182"/> thoſe who are able to preach ſhould guide themſelves in that publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
                     <p>But if Diſcourſes at this day made in Pulpits ought only ſo far forth to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Preaching, as they are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Churches Sermons; then all is not Preaching which bears that name, and takes up the Circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto allowed.</p>
                     <p>In the pious Sermons of the Church, we find Principles of Chriſtianity ſolidly explained, Rules and Motives of honeſt and holy Life clearly laid down, and Perorations and Perſwaſions to continue therein, devoutly and charitably dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and applied. I ſhall not draw this into compariſon; but only ſay, That I hope there is none need think it any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution or diſparagement to his Parts and Learning, to write after ſuch a Copy. And however the Homilies may be decried through popular Ignorance, Prejudice, and Paſſion, yet no doubt but they are ſtill neceſſary upon their firſt deſign, which was to help the Inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſome, to reſtrain the Indiſcretions of others, and to take away thoſe ſtrifes about what is fitting to be preacht, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the variety of Mens Judgments, the extravgance of their Fancies, and the Byaſſes of ſeveral Intereſts.</p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:104696:182"/>
                     <p>And as for the Homilies of this Church, they deſerve a much better eſteem than generally they receive; and would need no elaborate Vindication, if duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in their circumſtances. For in the firſt place, they are be to looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as popular Sermons, fitted unto the Capacities and Conditions of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; who being more led by Paſſion than Reaſon, have need of ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, as will rather regulate their will, than inform their judgment. They ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in more need to have their Hearts and Conſciences wrought upon for good Life and Converſation, than their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and apprehenſion with any curious piece of Learning or Science. And that the greateſt ſhare of the Church-Homilies deals herein, there will need no other proof than their diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual.</p>
                     <p>In the Second place, The Church-Homilies are not to be looked upon as her Dogmatical Reſolutions and Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but as they contain godly and wholeſom Doctrine [Teaching] and neceſſary for the times when they were compoſed. For ſo much we are taught in the 35. Article. And therefore I humbly ſuppoſe, that every paſſage in the Homilies is not to be preſſed for the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104696:183"/> Faith and Doctrine of the Church, but that the whole ought to be conſidered as confronting the evil Opinions and Manners that at their compoſing were held and practiſed: and if ought of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be remaining, the Homilies may ſtill be needful upon their Primitive account.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, the very time in which the Homilies were compiled may excuſe many a Period therein. For our Anceſtors were lately come out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and converſed daily with Perſons of that Perſwaſion; and therefore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere dehortations were requiſite to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from Apoſtacy into thoſe Practices out of which they had ſo lately been recovered: which makes it no wonder if Enforcements and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to that purpoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time too hardly ſtretched. And as for mine own part, I am ſo far from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing the pious Sermons of the Church, that conſidering their circumſtances, I greatly eſteem them for their own <hi>Worth,</hi> and reſpect them above any other for their <hi>Authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as to thoſe who reject Homilies upon the account that Apochryphal Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are not to be uſed in the Church, it may ſuffice briefly to reply,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:104696:183"/>1. That Apochryphal Writings were publickly read in the Church in Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times: as the Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens</hi> in that of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>Hermes</hi> (the ſame whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaluted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.14.) his <hi>Paſtor</hi> was publickly read in the Churches, and uſed by ſome of the moſt ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and thought highly neceſſary. <hi>Vide Euſeb. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. What may be ſaid to this purpoſe of the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of <hi>Theophilus</hi> B. of <hi>Antioch,</hi> I leave to the judgment of others. <hi>Vid. Euſeb. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in the Reformed Churches (not long ſince) <hi>Calvins</hi> Sermons upon <hi>Job</hi> were publickly read, by which means (ſaith <hi>Beza</hi> in his Preface to thoſe Sermons) the want of Preachers was ſupplied.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That it is all one to the People, whether the Sermon was made and printed in 1587, or on the laſt Sunday-Eve; whether it be out of a Book, or <hi>ex tempore</hi> of the Brain, if thereby they be truly edified. The Council of <hi>Vaus</hi> appointed the Homilies of the Fathers to be read by the Deacons in thoſe Churches, where the Presbyters through infirmity were abſent, <hi>Concil. Vaſſu. c.</hi> 4. <hi>Vid.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> Eccleſ. Pol. <hi>lib.</hi> 5.</p>

                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:104696:184"/>5. That there is more ſecurity in a <hi>Homily</hi> than a <hi>Lecture;</hi> as there is in the Learning, Piety and diſcretion of many, than a ſingle perſon. In ſhort: there can be no miſchief in the word [Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies] ſeeing the beſt Sermons (St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtoms</hi>) that ever were writ by any but an inſpired Pen, bear that Title. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mileticus</hi> and <hi>Tractator</hi> are often uſed indifferently: and the latter is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known to ſignifie a Preacher, as <hi>Tractare</hi> to Preach, among the Writers of the Latin Church. And the Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Auguſtine</hi> made upon St. <hi>John</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tractatus,</hi> &amp;c. And the Reaſon of the Name, was the handling of the Scriptures that had been read; the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom being to Expound or Preach upon ſuch Portions of Scripture as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Leſſons of the Day; as hath been obſerved out of <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>'s Second Apology. Something of this has been in uſe with our own Church, when the Sermon was ſpent in preſſing the intention of the Goſpel for ſuch a day unto the people; which is ſtill the cuſtom of the Romaniſts.</p>
                     <p>But leaving every one to his own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent herein, I cannot perceive why in ſtead of villifying the old Homilies, we ſhould not rather deſire a ſupply of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104696:184"/> 
                        <hi>new ones:</hi> ſuch as may contain a famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Orthodox inſtruction in the whole Body of Chriſtian Doctrine, and of all the capital Duties therein required; That thereby an Uniform way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction might be maintained as no unlikely means both to regain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Peace and Unity in this Church.</p>
                     <p>But without further purſuing the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Preaching, we will here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it in the moſt trodden and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acception, namely, as <hi>A way of inſtructing the people contradiſtinct to Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing;</hi> and to which it <hi>ſtands in uſual compariſon as ſtrong meat</hi> to <hi>Milk.</hi> Now that Preaching in this obvious ſenſe is no proper means to recover us of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, and to beget in us a ſober and fixed Judgment in the things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as it is generally ſuppoſed) comes to be made manifeſt in this following Chapter.</p>

                     <p>THat Difference which Divines make of things neceſſary to Salvation, either as a <hi>Means</hi> without which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had at all, or as <hi>Commands</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe obſervation thoſe cannot be ſaved to whom thoſe Commands are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, might have place here, if we were to ſpeak of Preaching, as by ſome it is looked upon, for an Inſtrument without which not one poor Soul can be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from deſtruction, nor any Sabbath hallowed either by Prieſt or People as God requireth. Which was the Opinion of <hi>T. C.</hi> and is ſtill of his Proſelytes. But it belongs not to the purport of this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> to ſet down how far <hi>Preaching</hi> (in the common Notice) is neceſſary as a means of Salvation: For then we muſt deſcend to particular Perſons, in reſpect of whom the true value of its <hi>neceſſity</hi> muſt be taken, ſeeing that none will ſay it can be alike neceſſary to the Salvation of all.</p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:104696:185"/>
                     <p>There is none ſhall give more to the worth and neceſſity of Preaching, and be more frequent therein than my ſelf. But yet I doubt not, but that a man may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without it. For if a perſon who in his Infancy hath received Holy Baptiſm, at years of <hi>Diſcernment,</hi> ſhall by <hi>Catechiſm</hi> be minded of all that he then <hi>vowed</hi> and <hi>promiſed,</hi> and be careful to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>do</hi> them, I ſee not what ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wants of being ſet in a ſtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that with equal eſteemers can be accounted neceſſary as a means thereof; tho' he <hi>knew</hi> no more of Preaching, than they in <hi>Act.</hi> 19. did of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>But let Preaching be a means never ſo neceſſary to ſave our Souls; yet that it is not ſo ſutable and proper to reform and fix our erroneous and inconſtant Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as is conceived) ſeems clear and evident upon the force and obviouſneſs of this ſingle inſtance; namely, That thoſe who have been, and ſtill are the greateſt admirers of popular Preaching, and the moſt eager hearers of many Sermons, and the moſt reſtleſs followers of ſeveral <hi>Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> have notwithſtanding all this, been, and are, 1. The moſt inconſtant, 2. The moſt erroneous in their Opinions.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, as for their Giddineſs and Unconſtancy, there needs no other
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104696:186"/> demonſtration thereof, than their rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one Opinion to another. For if they have ſtuck faſt to any one, yet that being evil, their adherence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ought not to be accounted <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> but <hi>Perverſeneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if we enquire into the cauſe of this fickleneſs of judgment ſo notorious among the zealous Sermoniſts, and <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Sectaries,</hi> we ſhall find that it is a want of Catechizing; and that they were never duly inſtructed in thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Principles of Religion, which would have rightly inform'd and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their Judgments. Through the want whereof, they have proved like unballaſted Veſſels, liable to be toſſed, torn, and blown about with every guſt of contrary Doctrine, vented by thoſe who were crafty to deceive; and who have proved themſelves to be lineally deſcended of thoſe great pretenders to Godlineſs and Knowledg (mention'd in the Inſpired and Eccleſiaſtick Scriptures) and egregiouſly character'd, <hi>for creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into houſes, and ſeducing ſilly women, who were ever learning, but never able to come to the knowledg of the Truth.</hi> Vide <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Eccleſ.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104696:186"/> ſeeing they began to learn it at the wrong end, and ran to the Lecture before they had been at the Catechiſm.

                     <p>And as the moſt unſatiable Hearers of Sermons have proved wavering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant in their judgments, for want of a timely and through Catechizing; ſo likewiſe upon the ſame ground they have been very erroneous and Opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. For this want of a plain <hi>Inſtitution</hi> in the Principles of Truth, hath left them deſtitute of a proper Teſt, whereby they might be able to explore and try what is preacht, and to ſeparate the <hi>pretious</hi> from the <hi>vile.</hi> Through the want whereof, they as greedily imbibe a falſe as true Doctrine; and are ready to change their Opinions according to the impreſſion which the affectionate noiſe of the laſt Sermon has made upon their <hi>Senſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor are they happier in their reading Holy Scriptures, than in hearing of them (thus) preacht. The Un-cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized run upon the ſame Rock in both.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104696:187"/> For albeit the <hi>Divine Word</hi> is in it ſelf the pure Fountain of all <hi>ſaving Truths:</hi> yet perſons not trained up in a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent apprehenſion of Catechiſtical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, make it a ſink of pernicious Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; ſucking Contention from the Breaſts of Peace; turning the ſincere Milk of Gods Word into the Poyſon of Aſps, and perverting the <hi>Scripture</hi> to their own deſtruction; while they make the Oracles of God not to ſpeak their own, but ſuch a Senſe and Language, as may beſt adjuſt their Deſigns and <hi>Intereſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as no malice proves more impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable than that which ariſeth out of the Aſhes of an Apoſtate love: So no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are more dangerous than thoſe which proceed from a wrong interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and application of <hi>the Word of Truth.</hi> And as thoſe whoſe fancy has been playing with ſounds, think every thing they hear is tunable to their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: So thoſe whoſe minds are once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with evil Opinions, think every Text ſpeaks according to the Opinions wherewith they are infected. And it is an Hypotheſis will meet with few Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, That Men who are prejudiced and prepoſſeſſed with Errors in Religion, cannot be reduced but by getting them
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104696:187"/> therein rightly principled, which was never yet attempted but by ſolid and perſpicuous Catechizing; it being by this that Men prove in Religion like the Houſe in the Goſpel founded upon a Rock, which by no force of ſtorms and winds could be ſubverted. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this <hi>ground-work</hi> be not ſurely laid, all <hi>ſuperſtructures</hi> in Religion lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the looſe Sand, and are eaſily waſht away by the inſinuating ſuggeſtions of falſe Teachers. And what is yet further to be conſidered, we ſee the reſt of the <hi>Building</hi> ſink with the Foundation: if that be ſhaken, all will go to ruine. And Chriſtians not well grounded in the Elements of Truth and Holineſs, will quickly be perſwaded to give themſelves up to any wild Opinion, or looſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and turn Schiſmatick or Traytor, to the great hazard and confuſion both of Church and State.</p>
                     <p>But if it be objected that Catechizing is a Plaiſter too narrow for our Sore, becauſe it cannot reach thoſe whoſe Age, or ſome other Circumſtance, excludes them the number of thoſe for whom this ſort of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> is appointed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they have no leſs need thereof than others: To this it will be enough to return the ſucceeding conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>And in the firſt place, Catechiſing is in an eminent manner conducive to the Peace and Welfare of the State; becauſe it takes care that the Younger ſort, who are the hopes of a Nation, be duly edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104696:189"/> in thoſe Principles, on whoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the ſafety and happineſs of a State depends. For to ſowe in the pure minds of <hi>Youth</hi> the Seeds of Vertue and Truth, before the Tares of Vice and Error, and the Weeds of the <hi>World,</hi> have canker'd and ſpoiled the Soil, is by the conſent of all wiſe men, a point of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable force and moment for the well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and Government of all kind of Societies, and for making Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths ever flouriſhing and happy. For by the means of Catechiſing, the Younger ſort will be planted and grow up in a due Conformity and Obedience to the Laws in being; which is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably a proper expedient to uphold <hi>States</hi> in the Terms wherein they are, and to free them from the danger of being ſo eaſily obvious to alteration and change. For the Opinions, of what nature ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, wherewith we are firſt ſeaſon'd, are of double force to any ſecond Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and <hi>Uſages.</hi> And this makes the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation early and careful in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing their Children; by which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod (ever ſince its uſe) they have not ſuffer'd the leaſt <hi>diſturbance</hi> and <hi>alteration</hi> in Church or <hi>State.</hi> That <hi>ſerious people</hi> having largely experienced the Truth of their own ſaying: <hi>No es menos impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante

But we need not go ſharpen our Tools with the Philiſtines, ſeeing an Iſraelite can do it better. For <hi>Solomon</hi> is plain, That the way to have Men Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Honeſt; to be peaceable both in Church and State; is from their Childhood to train them up (the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) to Catechize them, in the Duties that they owe unto both, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. And the Eccleſiaſtick and Politick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as well as the Natural, will find great ſafety in obſerving the wiſe advice of <hi>Ben Sirach.

And we need not doubt but a right Conſcience will as powerfully oblige to <hi>Peace,</hi> as an erroneous inſtigate to <hi>Sedition:</hi> And that if Men were once fully Catechiſed in the Duties of the <hi>Second Table,</hi> they would no longer be able to reſiſt the Eccleſiaſtick or Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power under the <hi>Banner</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

                     <p>In the ſecond place, an Unanimous uſe of Catechiſing the People in the ſame things, will not a little redound to the credit of the Clergy. For by this means they will teſtifie to the World their <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> and <hi>Conſent:</hi> That they all teach the ſame things; and are not, as for lack hereof ſome imagine, like the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts two-headed Serpent, pulling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ways, but all looking on the ſame Objects as the Seraphims on the Mercy-Seat.</p>
                     <p>And doubtleſs one end of a Church-Catechiſm was to preſerve an Uniform procedure in teaching the Common grounds of Religion. It being requiſite and convenient, that they who profeſs but one God, one Chriſt, one Baptiſm, and one Goſpel, ſhould conſent and be trained up in one Catechiſm. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience ariſing from the uſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, being obſerved by Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the Eighth, cauſed him to have a Catechiſm compiled, which, excluſive of all others, ſhould be taught in all thoſe Countries that call themſelves Catholick. <hi>Ut ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latâ modorum docendi varietate, uniforme, faciliuſ<expan>

                     <p>And in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Liturgy, we find their Paſtors limited not only to the ſame Catechiſm, but alſo to how much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſhall teach every <hi>Lords day,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any interpolations of their own. A thing which ought carefully to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in our own Church: For if the Clergy be either left to a liberty of uſing divers Catechiſms, or to uſe the Churches as they pleaſe; and under a pretence of the <hi>legal Inſtruction,</hi> take a more ſecure occaſion to inſtil into the minds of the unwary people their own Opinions and Fancies, they may moſt maliciouſly deceive the intention of the Church, and for feeding, poyſon their <hi>Congregations.</hi> They will prove falſe to their truſt, and moſt perniciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the name they bear. For the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are Catechiſts in the moſt important ſenſe of their Office, and are bound by that Title not to ſound their own words, but to eccho and repeat what the Church has ſpoken; not only the Words and Syllables, but the ſenſe and meaning.</p>
                     <p>But if the Clergy were never ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and diligent both in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and practice of the Catechiſm, the benefit thereof will not be ſo viſible, while there are thoſe who unteach in private what is taught at Church. Which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104696:191"/> is the undermining practice of many of thoſe <hi>Petite</hi> Schools, wherewith the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſurcharged and abuſed. The moſt whereof being ſubſervient to no better end than to give the <hi>Youth</hi> an ill ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well in the Rudiments of Religion as Grammar. And albeit the redreſſing of this miſchief has been piouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Sovereign Head of this Church, to <hi>Perſons</hi> proper for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; yet it is to be feared that the iſſue will be rather an <hi>Encreaſe</hi> of <hi>Licenſes,</hi> than any <hi>Abatement of undue School-Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> contrary to the 77 and 79. Canons.</p>
                     <p>Till <hi>Iſrael</hi> wanted Smiths of their own, they never went to the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> to ſharpen their Mattocks. It ſeems no leſs a want of Policy than Affection in the Church, while her own Breaſts are full to ſuffer her Children to ſuck ſuch Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as with their Milk will infuſe <hi>Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> againſt her.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuites uſually ſay, That they never doubt to replant their Religion, where they have once planted a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; becauſe this being obtained, they will have opportunity to inſtruct the Youth (which is an employment they every where labour to engroſs to their Society) whereby they fear not but in time to eat out the Fathers <hi>Principles</hi> with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104696:192"/> thoſe they ſhall inſtil into the Son. And the preſent ſtate of Affairs will eaſily turn this into no unſeaſonable Alluſion.</p>
                     <p>But in the laſt place, the unanimous u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the ſame Church-Catechiſm, and the modd'ling, ordering, and directing all publick Inſtructions according to this <hi>Form of Sound Words,</hi> will bring no leſs ſafety to the People, than Honour to the Clergy. For by this means the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be delivered from the fear and peril of hearing contrary Doctrines, and conſequently be edified and built up in ſuch an Uniformity both of <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> as may at once ſecure as well their Converſations as Judgments from Ungodlineſs and Error; which yields a fair probability of cloſing our preſent <hi>breaches,</hi> and preventing future.</p>
                     <p>And now ſeeing that the welfare of the State, the credit of the Clergy, and ſafety of the People do greatly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and ſollicite the practice of Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; there is nothing on the Clergies part that can retard it, but what I ſhould be loath to name or imagine. But if it be ſaid in behalf of the Laity, That Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing being a conſtant repetition of the ſame thing, will ſo cloy the people, that they will grow weary of Gods Houſe; to which we ſee them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104696:192"/> backward, even when they are there entertained with variety: Then I ſhall only wiſh all thoſe of the Holy Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction maturely to conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How low they have ſunk in their eſteem with the people, ſince their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was ſo much devoted to pleaſe <hi>their</hi> humours.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they ought not ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Peoples Fancies, as proficiency in Religion; the informing of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and directing their Conſciences, and not the humouring of their caprices, ought to be their chief aim and travel.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That they cannot deſerve the Name of Guides, who are ruled by thoſe whom they ſhould rule: the iſſue whereof will be no better than that of <hi>the blind lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That if Catechiſing be a way of Inſtruction, which will beſt preſerve the Unity and Peace of the Church, and moſt ſolidly and ſecurely advance the edification of the people; then there is no need to be ſollicitous for any other ends or intereſts.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And as for the conſtant repetition and audience of the ſame Truths neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation (as they are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Church-Catechiſm) it may be juſtified by that old ſaying <hi>[Nunquam
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104696:193"/> ſatis docetur, quod nunquam ſatis diſcitur;]</hi> Thoſe Leſſons can never be too much taught, which can never be too much learned. For repetition in this caſe is to make the Catechiſm, what indeed it is, the Words of the Wiſe faſtned like Nails by the Maſters of Aſſemblies. And though in all the blows of the Hammer the act be the ſame, yet there is no ſtroke ſuperfluous, while every one tends to compleat the Work. We may bring the ſame quarrel againſt <hi>reading Books,</hi> and <hi>hearing Sermons:</hi> for they are but old matter in new words; and if ſtript of <hi>Dreſs</hi> and <hi>Diſguiſe,</hi> they would eaſily be diſcerned to be but ſo many varied repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. In Religion, if any thing be pretended to be <hi>new,</hi> we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it is <hi>falſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. But to evacuate the whole Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a diligent Catechiſt will find enough in the Church-Catechiſm to entertain his Congregation with variety, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and profit all but <hi>itching Ears.</hi> For it wants nothing that is requiſite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us in our <hi>Journey,</hi> or to ſave us when come to our <hi>long home.</hi> And thoſe who are therein duely inſtructed, will find themſelves ſo ſufficiently guarded, that no Machinations of Hereſie or Schiſm will be able to batter or undermine

Indeed the diligent uſe of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing will be its beſt Vindication, and moſt effectually anſwer all Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. And without all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, there was never a greater neceſſity of enforcing what we now treat of, than the conjuncture wherein we live. For we ſee Satan is let looſe, and lays hard at the Souls of Chriſtians; not only by ſuch Opinions as diſturb our Peace, but would utterly deſtroy our Chriſtianity.

                     <p>In the next place, by virtue of its Authority, the Church-Catechiſm hath an eſpecial Uſefulneſs, in being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Teſt by which we may try who are of, or againſt our Communion. It is likewiſe an excellent Form of Religion, whereby particular perſons may examine their own Opinions and Sentiments, and give an account of their <hi>Faith</hi> to thoſe who would therein either <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> or <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, the Accompliſhment of the <hi>Church-Catechiſm</hi> greatly enhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its Commendation. For if its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents fall under an upright Review, it will merit no leſs praiſe than thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures, which are ſo exact, that they are neither defective nor redundant. For although ſome have objected its deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as not taking any notice of the great Points of Faith, Juſtification, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may hereunto be truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That theſe Points are rather briefly expreſt, than totally omitted; and that it is not the omiſſion, but the ſhort and Orthodox Expreſſion thereof, which is the ground of the Exception. But if the nature of a Catechiſm were right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104696:195"/> weighed, it would be no Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Churches, that ſome things are therein either more darkly or more ſuccinctly ſet down. For if every point of Doctrine were in a Catechiſm diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd at length, it would loſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit its Name. But beſides all this, it is eaſie for a <hi>Clerk</hi> of ordinary <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> to make all thoſe Points plain and obvious out of the <hi>Church-Catechiſm,</hi> whoſe want is objected againſt its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs. And we have no reaſon to wonder or repine, that the Church hath left ſomething to exerciſe the labours and abilities of her Clergy.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude: If we maturely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Catechiſm, we ſhall find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch a natural evenneſs in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Stile, and ſuch a conſiſtency and ſoundneſs in the Matter, as is not in any like compoſition eaſily to be matcht. As for the Introduction, it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally carries us to all the circumſtances of our admiſſion into the Church, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when, by whom, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by what means we became Chriſtians. Next, it acquaints us with the great Priviledges, Benefits and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſtianity, as alſo how by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow we ſtand obliged to perform them. The Queſtion is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>ſhort;</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:104696:195"/> the Anſwer full and <hi>pithy.</hi> wnd the Compilers thereof have manifeſted a ſingular wiſdom and care, in delivering the Rule in the feweſt and plaineſt words. For if they had loaden it with long indicative Periods, they might at once have both puzzl'd the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and oppreſſed the memory of thoſe tender Capacities for whom chiefly it was deſigned.</p>
                     <p>If we look into the principal Chapters of the Catechiſm, the Church therein has followed the Copy of the beſt and ancienteſt Catechiſts: For like them, ſhe hath reduced to four general Heads, all that is truly neceſſary to Salvation. For retrenching what is but artificially neceſſary to acquire the Felicity of the future ſtate, all truly neceſſary thereunto, is reduceable, 1. To Faith, or things to be believed. 2. To Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or things to be done. 3. To Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or things to be received. 4. To Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or things to admit and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh us in the Church.</p>
                     <p>As for the things we are to believe, they are ſumm'd in Twelve Articles, bearing the Name of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> becauſe it was either of their compoſing, or contains the ſubſtance of all which they taught to be neceſſary for <hi>ſingle Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:104696:196"/> and was collected by Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Men, out of their Writings, into this Form or Breviary that we now profeſs.</p>
                     <p>As for Obedience, the Decalogue is its Rule and Object, which compriſeth a pure draught of practical Duties.</p>
                     <p>Prayer, which makes another Head of the Catechiſm, is an Auxiliary to the two former; for unleſs we beg and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Divine Aſſiſtance, we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe nor obey as we ought.— <hi>Know this, that thou art not able to do theſe things of thy ſelf, nor to walk in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God without his ſpecial Grace, which thou muſt learn at all times to call for by diligent Prayer.</hi> And the moſt abſolute Form and Pattern of this Duty, is that which Chriſt collected when he reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>Euchologus,</hi> out of the Traditions of the Elders, and recommended to his Church, and which bears his Name, <hi>The Lords Prayer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sacraments are the fourth Head of Catechiſm, which God ordained in compliance with Mans infirmities and weakneſs. For being that thoſe things which concern the <hi>Endleſs Welfare</hi> of the Rational Soul, are like it ſelf of Spiritual and Divine Nature, and therefore not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be comprehended by thoſe who
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104696:196"/> have their Underſtanding limited by their Senſes; it pleaſed God to appoint certain <hi>Holy Rites</hi> called Sacraments; which by outward and viſible Signs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us that inward and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Grace which he beſtows upon us; and which are alſo means whereby we are partakers of that Grace, and Pledges to aſſure us of that participation.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> An Account of ſome Objections uſually brought againſt the Church-Catechiſm.</head>
                     <p>IT hath been generally obſerved, That Zeal, if it be not ſoberly governed when it ſtriveth againſt any thing, that either in reality or but appearance, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Religion, doth uſually proceed with ſo great impetuouſneſs, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf is in danger. And as it not ſeldom falls out, That an over-eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pluck up Weeds, doth hazard the extirpation of the good Grain; ſo a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter zeal againſt what is Superſtitious, or but ſo pretended to be, doth often put both the Truth and Practice of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into ſuſpence and debate. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this is an Obſervation which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104696:197"/> might be eaſily atteſted through all the <hi>Periods</hi> of the Church, yet we need not look ſo far back for Teſtimony thereof, if we revolve what has happened among our ſelves within the Annals of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. For we have ſeen the malice of the <hi>Detracting Spirit</hi> of Faction and Sedition expoſing every Inſtitute of the Church to contradiction and reproach; account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it Argument enough to abandon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing uſed by the Church, on which there could any way be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd the odious Names of <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though this might be exemplified through the whole Body of the <hi>Churches</hi> Liturgy, yet the preſent Theme obliges me to remark only ſuch Cavils as with greater ſpeciouſneſs are brought againſt the Catechiſm. For as for other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, the ſmalneſs of their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance renders very needleſs to return them any ſolid anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Now the firſt thing objected againſt the Catechiſm, reſpects its two firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, which are traduced as ſuperfluous and trifling, as being to no more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than to ask what we know already, and to be informed of that which we perfectly underſtood before: Seeing that uſually falls out, that the Catechiſt is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104696:197"/> well acquainted with the Catechumens Name, and all the circumſtances of its impoſition.

                     <p>But this Objection will appear of ſmall force and importance, when it is conſidered, that the Church in her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm obſerves the Method which is natural to Diſcourſes fram'd by Queſtion and Anſwer; whoſe entrance is ever ſome familiar Interrogative agreeable to the matter which is to be diſcourſed. And ſeeing that the Church in her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm deſigned to inſtruct the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and younger ſort the Principles of that Religion which they profeſs, it was very proper to begin her Inſtruction with an enquiry for that Name in which they firſt undertook that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                     <p>And in this reſpect our publick Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm is more appoſite and genuine, than either the <hi>Roman Catechiſm</hi> eſtabliſhed by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104696:198"/> Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, or that of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> annexed to their Liturgy: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long Preamble, the one begins with, <hi>Quidnam Doctrina Chriſtiana?</hi> The other with, <hi>Quelle eſt la Principale fin de la Vie humaine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the entrance of our Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm will be further vindicated from the imputation of <hi>levity</hi> or <hi>ſuperfluouſneſs,</hi> when it is rightly conſidered, That it doth naturally guide the Catechiſed to the knowledge of what moſt near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imports him: For (as 'twere by the hand) it gently carries him to all the concerning circumſtances of his admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Church; by whom; at what time; and after what manner, he was made a Member of Chriſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Congregation of his Flock, and had a Right conferr'd upon him to partake of all the Promiſes and Priviledges of the New Covenant. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm being an inauguration into that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society which Chriſt founded.</p>
                     <p>And as we read that the People of God have from the beginning had names of ſpecial ſignification (as <hi>Adam, Chava, Abram,</hi> &amp;c.) whereby they were put in mind of ſome ſignal mark of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence toward them, and of their bounden duty of being piouſly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104696:198"/> So the Catechiſed, when he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Name in which he became a Chriſtian, it minds him of his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: 1. To depart from Iniquity, and thereby to walk worthy of that Name by which he is called. 2. To perform what in that Name he vowed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. 3. To examine his proficiency in that Religion into which by this name he was firſt initiate. 4. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a thankful remembrance of Chriſts ſingular favour, that he ſo far condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to call him after his own Name.</p>
                     <p>But the Catechumen may upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account be firſt called upon for his name, becauſe it is the badge and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of that Holy Religion in which he is to be inſtructed, and of which he muſt give an account both to God and his Church, now and at the laſt. And ſuperſeding all other Reaſons, thoſe that have been thus briefly intimated, may (at leaſt) aſſiſt to clear the firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and anſwer of the Catechiſm from the guilt of Trivialneſs, Vanity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency.</p>
                     <p>As to what is objected againſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion and anſwer, it will be ſufficient to reply, That our Church therein is confo mable to the Primitive. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> (a Father of the Third
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104696:199"/> age) ſaith poſitively, That it was the cuſtom of the Church in his time, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m t none to the benefit of the Scriptures, or to any diſpenſation concerning ſacred and divine things, or to the ſcanning and examination of particular Queſtions of Religion, who could not firſt give a clear account of all material circumſtances of their Reception into the Ark of Chriſt's Church. By whom, at what time, and after what manner they were received (which are the Ingredients of the ſecond anſwer in the Church-Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm) and whether they did ſtedfaſtly believe and maintain all thoſe general Principles, wherein there ever was an univerſal an unanimous agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Chriſtians. And thoſe who could not give an account thereof, were looked upon as ſuch who had no right to the Communion of Chriſt's Church, and the Priviledges of his Kingdom. This Teſtimony of the Churches practice is to be ſeen in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Praeſc. adverſ. Haeretic.</hi> A piece which was written by him, as I conceive, before the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy tempted him to turn a <hi>Montaniſt,</hi> and to be led away with the Enthuſiaſtick deluſions of that Sect. He lived in the third age, and was ſo high in the eſteem of the humble
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104696:199"/> and modeſt St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that he uſually called him his <hi>Maſter. Hierom. in Cat. Script. Eccleſ. Abraham Buchol. Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolog.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The impoſition of the Name being confined to the preciſe time of Baptiſm, is by ſome looked upon as an impertinent Rigor, and taſting highly of Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But they would be of another mind, if without prejudice they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Church, which hath always given Names to thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhe admitted into her Fellowſhip, at the punctual time of their admiſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this will be plainly diſcerned, if we look back unto Circumciſion (the firſt Characteriſtical Sacrament) for from the time of its Inſtitution, to that of its legal aboliſhment, the Male recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his name at the Celebration of that truly primitive Initiatory.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth it any way evacuat this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that we read of ſome who had names before they were circumciſed (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that admiſſory Rite was appointed) as <hi>Benoni, Gerſhom,</hi> and the Iſraelites born in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;<note place="margin">Gen. 35.18. Exod. 2. &amp; 4. Joſh. 5.2.</note> whom we may ſuppoſe not to have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Names, as they did Circumciſion. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104696:200"/> the Example of <hi>Benoni,</hi> it affords lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Objection, ſeeing that at Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion his Name was changed. And what happen'd concerning <hi>Gerſhom,</hi> it was as the inſtance of the Iſraelites in the Deſart, in this caſe not at all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative, becauſe it was extraordinary, and when neceſſity forced them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with Law. So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, we may conclude that Circumciſion was the uſual time for the impoſition of Names. And the like cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom has always been obſerved at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Baptiſm; the Church thinking it moſt convenient that the Baptiſed ſhould at the ſame time receive his Chriſtian Name, whereat he became a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But that for which the Church ſeems leaſt accountable, and which makes the greateſt noiſe, and which is objected with the faireſt plauſibility, is that which concerns Sureties in Baptiſm, whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is decri'd as unwarrantable, becauſe they undertake what they cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. And the very name (of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers) is ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, as a prophanation of the moſt Holy Name, being a Tranſgreſſion of the Third Commandment. And this is an Objection which cannot be better aſſoiled, than by laying
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104696:200"/> down a clear Scheme of the Antiquity and Reaſonableneſs of Sureties in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place the antiquity of Sureties, at and for the reception of Perſons into the Church, is indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For if we look into the Jewiſh Church when ſhe was in her beſt Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we ſhall find, that ever ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Circumciſion there were ſtill ſome appointed to be preſent, and hold out the Male to the <hi>Mohel</hi> to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. And the perſon allotted for this Office, was ſome ſpecial Friend of the Fathers, who is called the Maſter of the Covenant (but uſually in Latin, <hi>Initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis Arbiter, Suſceptor, Compater,</hi>) who at the Door of the Synagogue receives the child from the women, who are permitted to go further; and entring the Synagogue, the <hi>Suſceptor</hi> holds the child till the <hi>Hammohel,</hi> Circumciſer, has taken away the Foreskin. And how this cuſtom was primitively obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, and in point of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties derived to the Chriſtians, may be collected from what <hi>Junius</hi> has intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. compared with Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 1. from the 57 to the 60 Verſe.</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:104696:201"/>
                     <p>Now this cuſtom of Sureties in the Jewiſh Church, need not at all reflect upon the like in the Chriſtian. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was in the power of the latter to retain any Rite of the former that was apparently decent, ſignificant, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. For if every thing uſed by the Jew were to be rejected by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, then moſt of our Religion muſt be caſt out of doors. For it was not the deſign of our great Law-giver to aboliſh Judaiſm, but to amend, ſupply, and heighten it. Beſides, we find not that thoſe who were, or are the greateſt Impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and moſt impetuous gainſayers of Sureties in Baptiſm, ever did it upon the account that it was a Rag of Judaiſm.</p>
                     <p>But how dark and queſtionable this cuſtom may ſeem to ſome in its deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pedigree, yet its practice is clearly to be found in the firſt times of Chriſtianity. As they muſt needs know who have obſerved how frequently <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> occur in the Greek Fathers; and <hi>Suſceptores, Sponſores,</hi> and <hi>Fide juſſores,</hi> in the Latin. And how in both, the words ſignifie and refer to <hi>Undertakers</hi> at Baptiſm. <hi>Platina</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the Inſtitution hereof unto <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> who, ſaith he, ordain'd, that at the leaſt one <hi>Patrimus</hi> or <hi>Matria</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104696:201"/> preſent at Baptiſm, and there hold the Infant till he was baptiſed. <hi>Patrimus</hi> and <hi>Matrima</hi> are old Words, which by new impoſition denoted thoſe who undertook for the Vertuous and Pious education of the Baptiſed.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be granted, that <hi>Hygin</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was the Author of Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Godmothers, then this cuſtom is of an uncontroulable ancientneſs; for <hi>Hygin</hi> lived in the Second Age, and was a Martyr in the 144 of Salvation. And it is generally granted, that this good Biſhop took occaſion from thoſe Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which were heavy upon the Church, to appoint Sureties in Baptiſm. That in Caſe the Parents ſhould fall into violent reſtraint, baniſhment, or death, there might be ſome to take care of their childrens inſtruction in the truth of that Religion into which they were initiate.</p>
                     <p>But whatever was the firſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ground of this Suretiſhip, we are certain that for its great ſtanding in the Church, it may take place among thoſe Primitive Rites, which were in all deſcending Ages to be retained. And this will appear from the very Nature and Reaſon of the thing it ſelf. And a cuſtom or Law, though it cannot be elder, yet it may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104696:202"/> be ſuppoſed to be as old as its chief Motive and Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Now the neareſt Method to prove the reaſonableneſs of this cuſtom of Baptiſmal Sureties is to examine both what they do for the Child at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his Baptiſm, and what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for him for the future.</p>
                     <p>And as to what the Sureties do for the Child at the time he receives this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; <hi>Platina</hi> tells us, that was no more than to hold it in their arms till it was baptiſed, and to give it a name ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, or at leaſt not contrary to the Parents Directions. And this is a thing ſo harmleſs, that none can have any colour to quarrel or reject it.</p>
                     <p>And as for what the Sureties under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the childs ſtead for the future, it can merit no juſt reprehenſion; ſeeing it is no more than to be careful that the child be vertuouſly brought up to lead a Godly and a Chriſtian Life, and be taught ſuch things as are neceſſary to the attainment of Eternal Happineſs: according to the Exhortation of the Office of Publick Baptiſm. And to the end that this might not be over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom to the Sureties, the Church provides that her Curates ſhall diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach whom ſhe has baptiſed; and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104696:202"/> ſo to inſtruct them, that they may be fit for confirmation. At which time the Sureties are diſcharged of their Bands, becauſe at Confirmation the Baptiſed anſwer and undertake in their own Names, what their Sureties have done in their ſtead.</p>
                     <p>But it may ſtill be replied, That the Parents are fitteſt to engage for their Children, and that ſo weighty a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment ought not to be transferr'd unto Strangers. I muſt confeſs, this was once my own Perſwaſion; out of which I could not argue my ſelf, till I conſider'd: 1. That by the Law both of God and Nature, Parents are obliged to inſtruct their children in the things of God; and therefore need not to enter into Bonds. 2. That Parents may die before their Children arrive to a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being inſtructed; or they may be ignorant and unable, or negligent and careleſs to inſtruct them. 3. That the Parents may be corrupted with Schiſm and Hereſie, and by reaſon thereof be altogether unfit to perform this Office. And indeed, if we reflect upon the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Age we live in, the Church may ſeem never to have had more need of Sureties for their Orthodox inſtruction, whom ſhe takes into her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104696:203"/> For ſo many Parents are infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated with erronious Opinions, that none are more improper to engage for the regular <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of their children than themſelves. And if there were none of theſe Reaſons herein argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, yet the thing it ſelf is of ſo great importance, that the Church hath ever thought it inſecure to have none bound but the Parents. And there are, who upon no contemptible account, eſteem it very incongruous, that thoſe ſhould preſent the Child to be waſht of that pollution which it derived from them. And upon this ſcore it might be, that the Father was wont not to be admitted to be preſent at the Baptiſm of his Child, but ſtood at the Church-door while the Infant was carried in and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zanchius,</hi> who was well read in the Writings of the ancient Fathers of the Church, ſpeaking of this cuſtom of Godfathers and Godmothers in his Commentaries upon the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of its antiquity; that it oppoſeth no period of Holy Writ; that it is an Effect of the Parents love and care to their children thus to make all poſſible proviſion for their Religious Inſtitution: That it is beneficial for the Infant in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104696:203"/> caſe of the Parents death, and an aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the Parents if they live: That it is a means to beget and increaſe mutual kindneſs among Neighbours; becauſe hereby a ſpiritual alliance is contracted, which may greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the propagation and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Chriſtian charity. And we may add to all this, that not a few children would inevitably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd of Holy Baptiſm, if none but their Parents could be admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto to preſent them, and to ſtipulate in their Names.</p>
                     <p>But it is in the next place ſtrongly objected againſt what is vowed by the Sureties in behalf of the Baptized, as alſo that it looks very contrary to the Nature of a Vow for one to make it in behalf of another. And here not to meddle with the Nature of Vows in General, nor particularly of that of Baptiſm; it may ſufficiently evacuate all Scruples, plainly to conſider, that no more is done in this Baptiſmal Suretiſhip, than is both done and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in Secular affairs, in which it is allowed, that Infants act by their Tutors, Proxies and Guardians, and that too in matters of no ſmaller concernment than Eſpouſals and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104696:204"/> 
                        <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and at a time when they are as uncapable to underſtand and perform what is undertaken in their Names, as here at Baptiſm. It has alſo been ever thought both juſt and reaſonable for debtors to procure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be bound with them for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that for which at preſent they are inſufficient. And we may ſafely ſuppoſe that God will be as merciful in ſuch caſes as our ſelves; and that he will as readily accept of Sureties for the Chriſtian Education of an Innocent Infant, as we for an inſufficient Debtor.</p>
                     <p>But for a more evident comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole caſe, I conceive it may be thus ſtated. At the Font when the Infant is brought to Holy Baptiſm, the Sureties put on his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſubſtitute themſelves into his place: They repreſent his Voice, and anſwer in his ſtead. [All which is to be ſeen in the demands and anſwers in the adminiſtration of Publick Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants to be uſed in the <hi>Church.</hi>] And the Infant engageth under this Perſonation, That when he comes to years, he will perform the Vow and Promiſe thus made by his Subſtitutes. He and they being by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104696:204"/> interpretation but as one perſon; and therefore the Infant, when grown up, is as much bound to diſcharge what at Baptiſm was promiſed in his Name, as if he had done it himſelf. Now by this Subſtitution the Sureties perform a great act of <hi>Charity:</hi> for they do that for the child, which by no means he could do for himſelf; for they get him an early intereſt in the priviledges of Chriſtianity, which in the ordinary way of procedure, cannot be had without Baptiſm: and this cannot be had without making the Vow thereof; and it is impoſſible for the Infant to make this Vow, but by its Proxies; who oblige themſelves no further, than to ſee that the <hi>Infant be taught ſo ſoon as he ſhall be able to learn, what a Solemn Vow, Promiſe, and Profeſſion he has made by his Subſtitutes,</hi> or Sureties.</p>
                     <p>And by this ſhort account of what the Godfathers and Godmothers do for the Infant in Baptiſm, it is eaſie to apprehend, that none need withdraw from this Pious Work, for the ſuppoſed Difficulty of its Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. And therefore thoſe who rightly underſtand this Suretiſhip, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104696:205"/> yet refuſe it, they may be thought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to want Charity than Power; and that they are unwilling, and not unable to perform it.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth it leſs reflect upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, who turn this pious Cuſtom into an idle Ceremony, by privately devolving upon the Parents, what they publickly undertook for their children; which doth at once fruſtrate and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the intendment of the Ohurch, and delude the Congregation of God's people.</p>
                     <p>But it may be further objected, That the Vow of Baptiſm being made by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, renders the Performance and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof by the <hi>Child,</hi> a thing of conſtraint, and not of election: for the baptized, when grown up, doth not follow his own choice, but his Sureties; and allows of what was at Baptiſm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in his behalf, not out of willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but pre-engagement; all which is opppoſite to the genuine Nature of a Vow.</p>
                     <p>And in Anſwer to this Objection, it will be convenient to obſerve, That the Vow and Promiſe made by Sureties in Baptiſm is not abſolute; for in an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſenſe, no man can undertake for another. But the Vow is conditional;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104696:205"/> and the Child when come to age, muſt either own it, or forfeit the benefits of Baptiſm. And as thoſe who are marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being <hi>Minors,</hi> when come to mature years, may chuſe whether the Marriage ſhall be ratified or reſcinded: So it is in the power of the Baptized at years of diſcretion, to acknowledge or renounce the Vow of Baptiſm. If he allow of, and conſent to what at holy Baptiſm was vowed in his Name (which is ſtill ſuppoſed at the making of the Vow,) then he is bound actually to believe and do it. But if he diſclaim it (which is in his power) then he diſowns all Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Priviledge in Chriſt, with all the benefits of that Society into which by Baptiſm he became incorporate.</p>
                     <p>The Catechiſm teacheth us out of the Creed, to believe, That God the Son hath redeemed all mankind; which cannot be true (ſay many) becauſe he died only for the Elect. But they would have no reaſon to impugn the Churches Doctrine in this particular, if thoſe Scriptures were impartially conſidered by them,<note place="margin">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104696:206"/> purpoſe to ſhew the ground of the Churches Doctrine, and to guide thoſe to the Topicks of their confutation, who gainſay this, <hi>I believe in God the Son, who hath redeemed me and all mankind.</hi> That his death was both ſufficient and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to ſave all mankind, but is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and efficacious for none but <hi>true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> is a diſtinction which being wiſely and ſoberly underſtood, would remove that claſhing, which ſome fancy there is, betwixt the Catechiſm and the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Many other Scruples brought againſt this <hi>excellent Catechiſm,</hi> are purpoſely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe they will eaſily be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in its (intended) Expoſition.

                  <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>WE have hitherto examin'd the Age and Advantages of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing, and found it to ſtand above the imputation of being either Novel or Superfluous. So that the only remaining Enquiry concerns its Practice. And this will exact no long diſquiſition, ſeeing every Station of men are therein ſo perfunctory and negligent. Now, as in a common Contagion, no leſs care muſt be had of the ſound than infirm; and the cure of ſingle perſons is required to the removal of the Epidemical Diſeaſe: So remiſsneſs in Catechiſing being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a common Malady, it behoves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to look after amendment, to the end that the Church may be healed of all thoſe Diſtempers faln upon her through lack of Catechiſing, and which, if not prevented with a timely interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104696:207"/> thereof, will effect that deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which they threaten and progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate.</p>
                  <p>And if we look into the perſons who are capable herein to be delinquent, they may be reduced either to ſuch as the Church has ordained to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or receive this Sovereign Medicine. The former are the Clergy in the whole denomination; for he among them who excepts, deceives both himſelf and the Church. And notwithſtanding that the Clergy in <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> bear divers appellations, importing the Dignity, Power, Holineſs, Excellency, Care, Tenderneſs, Diſcretion, and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of their Functions; yet there is no Title wherein they are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned than that of Catechiſt. For it doth (firſt) more immediately relate to that Errand on which from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they were ſent into the world— <hi>Go teach,</hi> &amp;c. And next, unto the want and ſupply of thoſe over whom God hath made them Overſeers. And while they own themſelves to be the Churches Miniſters, they ſhould take care to ſerve her in her own way. For ſince that was left for paths of their own, and more oyl and labour has been ſpent in <hi>arguing,</hi> than in <hi>teaching</hi> the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104696:207"/> of Chriſtianity, it is ſadly viſible how Religion has thriven among us. For from endeavouring to ſupport Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity with Buttreſſes of our own, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and malitious Enemies take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conclude that it cannot ſtand without them. The ſuperſtructure ſeems to be the proper matter of our care, where we believe the Ground-work lies immoveable. And bleſſed be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finiſher of our Faith, that he has founded it upon a Rock; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſo ſtrong, that the Gates of Hell, the ſtrength and ſubtilty of her greateſt Enemies can never be able to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Were we to deal with open Adverſaries of the Faith <hi>(Jew, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan, Pagan)</hi> the Ancient Fathers have ſhewn us an excellent way of procedure; but having to do with Profeſſors, whoſe evil manners have corrupted their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, not the proving of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Chriſtian Religion, but the enforcement of its Practice, ſeems to be the only neceſſary preſcription.</p>
                  <p>But without being deciſive, or ſtinting the ſpirit of any man, I hope it may be lawful to wiſh that the Clergy (out of a true ſenſe of what they are enjoyn'd and bound to obey, by the 59th Canon) would return to the <hi>good old way</hi> of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104696:208"/> for ſince this was ſhoulder'd out by <hi>Sermoning,</hi> the people have been poſſeſſed w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h ſtrange Whimſies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and hurried on by the Spirit of Schiſm and Sedition into all manner of Villanies.</p>
                  <p>A learned and pious Biſhop of this Church doth (as I am told) in his own Perſon and Cathedral perform this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. A few ſuch leading Examples would ſoon raiſe the ſunk Eſteem of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing, and vindicate it from being thought a Drudgery fit only for children and Curates. And I humbly conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that there is no Clergy-man need think it any leſſening of his <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> to be ſeen teaching <hi>God's People</hi> after the manner of the Holy Apoſtles and Primitive Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>Our Anceſtors (who knew ſomething as well as we) were not ignorant of the neceſſity and benefit of what is now moſt affectionately recommended; when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made it her 44th Injunction, and King <hi>James</hi> his command, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon-Lectures ſhould be converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Explanations of ſome neceſſary Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Catechiſm; out of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fore-ſight that this would be more advantageous to the <hi>People,</hi> than ſome <hi>ex tempore</hi> irruptions, or enlarging a few
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104696:208"/> contrived Breviates, upon deſultory Texts.</p>
                  <p>The Laity are the next ſort that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in can he faulty, to whoſe <hi>attentive thoughts</hi> I would moſt earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, firſt, the ſerious peruſal of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick adjoyned to the Catechiſm, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the 59th Canon: Next, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of their knowledge in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that by that former they may know their <hi>Duty;</hi> and by the latter their want of being catechiſed: And by both be induced to embrace what to their own damage and the <hi>Churches</hi> affliction they have undutifully neglected.</p>
